**MESSAGE FROM THE**

**NATIONAL CHAIRMAN**

_Time for the Qualitative Leap Forward_

```
I have always recapitulated the history of Uganda's economy and society
according to the phases they have gone through. This time, I will start with
1962, the year of Uganda's independence from the British after their control
of 68 years - starting with 1894 when they imposed a "Protectorate" on our
ancestors. By that time, as I have told you many times, Uganda had been partially
annexed to the British capitalist system through the creation of the small
enclave economy of the 3Cs and 3Ts; the 3Cs being Coffee, Cotton and Copper
and the 3Ts being Tea, Tourism and Tobacco. This small money economy was
covering only 9% of the homesteads; this meant that 91% of the homesteads
were still outside the money economy - living by the distorted pre-capitalist
mode of production of okukoiera ekidda kyonka (working only for the stomach)
mainly and some limited barter trade (Okuchurika).
```
```
In 1971, the ignorant Idi Amin came in and by the time we removed him in 1979,
cotton and copper production had collapsed and so had tea and tourism.
Only coffee and tobacco were still limping on. The whole economy had been
informalised and people were only getting products and foreign currency
through Magendo (smuggling), Kibaanda (forex black market) and Kusamula
(speculation, where you buy something scarce and sell it more expensively).
It has, therefore, been the task and pleasure of the NRM to take the collapsed
money economy of Uganda and the desperate society, through the following
five phases:
```
```
MANIFESTO 2025-2031 • 5
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
1) The minimum economic recovery that involved bringing back some of
the Cs and Ts and reformalising the money economy, thereby uprooting
_Magendo, Kusamula_ and _Kibaanda_ (smuggling, speculation and forex black
market respectively). This restored the small enclave (island) economy;

2) Expanding the small island economy by growing more coffee, more tea,
bringing more tourists, etc.;

3) Diversifying the economy by commercialising the hitherto subsistence
products such as milk, beef, bananas, maize, cassava, sugar-cane, fruits,
etc.,

4) Adding value to some of the products such as maize, sugar-cane, milk,
cotton, timber, etc.; and
5) Commencing entrance into the knowledge economy of auto-mobiles,
pharmaceuticals, vaccines, ICT, etc.

This is how this economy has grown from USD 3.9 billion in 1986 to USD 66.
billion by the end of the financial year 2025-2026 using the forex method and
USD 188 billion by the PPP method. In other words, the economy of Uganda has
expanded 17 times ever since 1986, in spite of the corruption and disorientation
of some of the actors. This recovery, expansion, diversification, value addition
to some extent and now entering the knowledge economy, has been enabled
by peace and security, correct macro and micro-economic policies and good
infrastructure.

With respect to infrastructure, we shall continue to expand, improve and
rationalise all the elements involved. Hitherto, some good effort has been done
on some of the roads from North to South and from East to West although some
of the already tarmacked roads need reconstruction. The under-budgeting that
had crept back and the suspected inflation of costs, will be firmly dealt with
so that the tarmac roads are continuously smooth and the murram roads are
well maintained. Besides, it is time to rationalise the whole transport system
by making it multi-modal, instead of the present uni-modal — mainly only the
roads. With the standard gauge and the repaired metre gauge railways and in

```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
```
liaison with Kenya and Tanzania, we shall be able to remove cargo from the
roads to the railway and also remove petrol tankers from the roads to the
pipeline, so that the roads remain for the passengers and light cargo.
```
```
Given where we are, my proposal is that we now clearly understand the
seven words that represent the different aspects of our recovery, expansion,
diversification, value addition and the beginnings of the new knowledge
economy. These are: peace (obusiingye); development (entunguuka— meaning
infrastructure both social and economic); wealth (obugaiga); jobs (emirimo);
services (obuweereza); markets; and Political Federation.
```
```
We have achieved a lot. However, we could have achieved much more if,
especially the leaders (political, religious, cultural and social), had properly
grasped our message on those aspects. Our message since the 1960s has never
changed. However, many leaders keep missing the core issues and going for the
peripheral. Let me amplify a bit, each of the seven words.
```
**(1) Peace.** Without peace, you cannot create prosperity, which is number one
of our historical missions. Prosperity how? Through the production of goods
and services and selling them, sustainably. We shall encounter this later when
we are talking about wealth. The NRM has been able to preserve peace for 40
years which no previous governments, over this area, have ever achieved except,
probably, the Bachweezi (900 AD to 1400 AD). How did we manage? Through
correct politics emphasising interests (business, markets, services, etc.) instead
of identity (tribes, religious sectarianism, gender chauvinism). This has enabled
us to unite our people politically and create strong national institutions such
as the Army, Political Parties, Police, etc. That is how Uganda has become a
Country that does not generate refugees but, instead, absorbs refugees. Today,
we have 1.8 million refugees in Uganda.

_(2)_ **_Development_** _(Entunguuka, Enkulakulana, Dongo lobo). This is comprised_
of foundational assets and services that the economy and society need. These
are: the roads, the railways, the pipelines, the electricity, the piped water,

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 7
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
the telephones, the schools, the health centres, etc, etc. It is these assets —
collectively termed as infrastructure — that support the economy (economic
infrastructure) and the society (social infrastructure). Without them, the
economy cannot grow. Moreover, these assets must enable us to have low
costs of doing business (transport, electricity, etc). These competitively lower
business costs that will enable our business people to succeed. How will they
make profits, if the input costs are high? How will our products be competitive,
if they are very expensive? This is how European products - e.g. cars, textiles,
etc., lost the global markets to Japanese, Chinese, etc., products. Above, I have
briefly told you how we are moving on infrastructure. The detailed plans for the
roads, the railway, the ICT backbone, the electricity, etc, etc, are in this manifesto.
The confusing thing about infrastructure, is that many leaders whohave not
understood the anatomy of economies, spend all the time talking about precisely
this — development which, as stated above, is comprised mainly of economic
and social infrastructure. What they miss is the fact that, at the end of the day,
you do not spend your night in a hospital or school or on the road. You must go
to your home. That is where you confront your personal and family problems
— poverty, joblessness, etc.

**(3) Wealth.** This is where wealth comes in. Wealth _(obugaiga, obuggaga),_
belongs to the individual, the family, a company, etc. Wealth creation is assisted
by development (e.g. infrastructure); but development does not ipso facto cause
wealth creation. Especially in the pre-capitalist traditional societies of Africa,
that huge Continent with a lot of natural resources but with, hitherto, a small
population, people may not have pressure to create modern wealth characterised
by money economies. They may content themselves with _okukolera ekidda
kyonka_ (working only for the stomach). In the case of Uganda, this has been
one of the causes of poverty. The other cause has been getting involved in the
money economy (such as producing colonial cash - crops), without _ekibaro._ We
have been telling Ugandans that you can actually create wealth even when the
development (e.g. infrastructure) is primordial. That is how you get families in
the cattle corridor, in distant Bundibugyo or in the isolated Kalangala, creating
more wealth and prosperity, than the people living in Kampala. Moreover, as

```
8 • MANIFESTO 2026-
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
you create wealth, you can install your own solar system for lighting, you can
_jolopii, alga akipi,_ etc., water from the roof and have safe water by your own
efforts, even as you await the arrival of the national efforts in development.
With good family incomes, you can send your children to private schools and
go to private and money paying health centres, if the government ones have
issues. Therefore, with income, a family can handle the issue of poverty, some
aspects of development and some aspects of service delivery. When I am
talking about wealth, I always remember the guidance of Jesus in the Book of
Matthew chapter 6, verse 33; It says: **_"Seek Ye_** **first** **_the Kingdom of God and His
righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you". When it comes_**
to society, I advise as follows: _"Seek ye first the homestead income and_ the rest
_shall be added unto you"._

```
Additionally, we have been informing Ugandans of the four sectors that
contain wealth creation opportunities. These are: (i) Commercial agriculture
(crops, livestock and fisheries), with ekibaro. The commercial agriculture we
have been informing our people about is of two types. These are: intensive
farming where you use a limited area, by selecting high value enterprises, that
can give the family good money even if the family has got only four acres or
less and extensive agriculture, on the other hand, where families with big land
can produce for us products that are low value per unit, but by doing it on a
big scale, you get good money. The high value enterprises we have, hitherto,
recommended were initially seven. These being one acre for coffee; one acre
for fruits; one acre for pastures, for feeding cattle; one acre for food crops
(bananas, cassava, emoondi, etc.); poultry and piggery in the backyard; and fish
farming near the wetlands. Recently, some people have recommended cocoa,
palm oil and avocadoes. I need to satisfy myself on the global demand for those
products. The seven activities I recommended in 1996 had internal, regional and
global demand that was big. The global demand for coffee is USD 460 billion,
fruits USD 688 billion, dairy products USD 893 billion, poultry products USD
336 billion, piggery USD 397.5 billion and fish USD 671.45 billion. However, the
Country also needs the low value products such as cotton, tobacco, tea, maize,
sugar-cane, indigenous cattle, etc. If you do these on a big scale, you will get
```
```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 9
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
good money. Somebody in Adjumani told me that you get Shs. 1 million from
an acre of cotton. That is bad if you only have one acre for earning money. If,
however, you have 10 acres, that is Shs. 10 million; 100 acres, Shs. 100 million;
1000 acres, Shs. 1 billion. You, therefore, get good money from these low value
products provided you do them on a big scale. Indigenous cattle (The Ankole
breed) were, initially, classified as low value. However, they have now become
very high value, some selling as much as Shs. 6 million per cow.

In order to maximise returns from agriculture, we need to grasp the importance
of the environment and water usage. There is now the rampant misuse of the
wetlands by growing rice there that is very low value per acre and under-utilising
the terrestrial parts of the country _(olukalu)_ by denying those parts water for
irrigation because the water has been misused for rice growing. Dr. Muranga, in
Bushenyi has increased the yield of bananas 10 times from 5.3 tonnes per hectare,
that the nearby Banyankore get, to 53 tonnes per hectare. This irrational use of
Uganda's land needs to stop. Fish farming at the edges of the swamps _(Emiiga,
kutubalama)_ is much more profitable. My ponds in tango, Teso, Kabaale, Kawumu,
give me Shs. 70 million as net per pond per year (with only one pond each site).
In Limoto (Pallisa) and Pacwa, the rice growers were getting Shs. 4.2 million
per acre. We shall massively, using earth-moving equipment or paid human
labour supported by government, whichever is cheaper, develop fish ponds on
the _miiga_ of our swamps, to liberate the nearby residents from poverty and, at
the same time, water will come back in the centre of the swamp so that we use
it for irrigation. Stop misusing the wetlands and under-utilising the terrestrial
parts (olukalu) of our Country. The example we have initiated at Limoto is the
way to go. Regarding the whole issue of wealth creation, I am reminded of the
parable of the sower in the Book of Matthew, chapter 13, verse 3-9 (GNT), It
**_says: "Jesus used parables to tell them many things. A man went out to sow
grain. As he scattered in the field, some of it fell along the path and the birds
came and ate it up. Some of it fell on rocky ground, where there was little soil.
The seeds soon sprouted, because the soil wasn't deep. But when the sun came
up, it burned the young plants; and because the roots had not grown deep
enough, the plants soon dried up. Some of the seeds fell among thorn bushes,_**

```

```

```

```
**_which grew up and choked the plants. But some seeds fell into good ground
and brought forth fruit, some hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
And Jesus concluded, "Listen, then, if you have ears!". Some of the seeds that_**
fell on fertile ground are people like Ijala of Serere using 2.5 acres and earning
Shs. 1,450,000,000 gross and Shs. 608,940,000 net annually from eggs, milk,
etc.; Nyakaana of Rwengaaju near Fort Portal earning Shs. 1,069,200,000 gross
and Shs. 183,600,000 net annually from eggs and milk, etc.; Hon. Byamukama
of Kikwaya, earning Shs. 1.3 billion gross and Shs. 660 million net; people like
Kizito Lawrence of Masaka, growing coffee in 2 acres and earning Shs. 15 - 16
million per annum; Basaangwa of Kamuli, earning Shs. 20 million from 5 acres;
then, Kacuro Benard of Bundibugyo earning Shs. 56.6 million annually from
Cocoa and Shs. 7.2 million per year in Palm Oil; and, finally, Erick Mbarara of
Katuna, Kabale, earning Shs. 35 million per annum from apples. These are the
small-scale and, sometimes, medium-scale farmers. You also, of course, have
the large-scale farmers and plantation owners such as Madhvani, Rai and yours
faithfully Yoweri Museveni and many others. Nyakaana has created 15 jobs in
1.3 acres. If farmers with a total of 7 million acres out of the 40 million acres
that can support arable activities, were to use the Nyakaana example, we would
create 105 million jobs. All Ugandans and all the refugees in Uganda would
get jobs and we would have to import other workers from the neighbouring
countries as happened in the colonial times. This is very easy. When I look at my
small town of Rushere that only boasted of 3 shops in 1967 and find that there
are now 619 permanent buildings in that unit, I confirm that our vision is not a
mirage. What has stimulated the phenomenal growth of Rushere Town? One
word: "milk". It is the dairy industry that we started nursing in 1967 but finally
launched in 1989, that has been the magnet pulling these Ugandans together.
I doubt whether the majority are from the area. There are 22 milk coolers in
Rushere Town today, each day handling 65,500 litres of milk. This quantity will
increase, when the farmers listen to my message and use irrigation and also
plough the farms and plant pastures instead of the cattle _kukunuuza_ (trying to
scrape something to eat) on the _gwamera gwene_ or _isubi ryameraryene_ (the
grass grew by itself).

(ii) The second sector of wealth is **manufacturing and artisanship.** Here, we are
referring to factories and artisan working, etc. Many of the factory owners are
friends from outside Uganda — Chinese, Indians, Arabs, etc. However, Ugandans
are also coming up. Look at the Mulwanas, the Sudhirs, etc. The factories are
for adding value to agricultural products, minerals, fresh water resources,
forests, etc. Then, there is the knowledge economy of automobiles, electronics,
vaccines, etc., where our people create the products of the brain.

```
(iii) Services
```
The third sector of wealth, are the services such as transport, medical, music,
preaching, tourism, hospitality, etc. Many people make a good living through
services. He or she is not producing a good (soap, salt, cloth, food, etc); but
he or she is providing a service of boda boda by transporting me from point
A to point B and I pay him or her. At the moment, services constitute 41.9%
of the economy of Uganda. Many of the services depend a lot on peace and
infrastructure. Industries like tourism, transport, entertainment, music,
hospitality, etc., immediately collapse when there is no peace. I was recently in
Egypt and some friends told me that their tourism business had collapsed during
the time of political chaos in that country. That is exactly what had happened
to our tourism here after Idi Amin took power in 1971. Therefore, I advise all
the services sector entrepreneurs to _kukyeena_ (curse) those who promote
chaos. They are enemies of our Country and also our livelihood. Good roads and
airports also encourage some of the services, such as tourism, transport, etc.

```
(iv) ICT
```
The fourth sector of wealth is ICT— using modern computer and internet-based
capacity to provide certain services. It is also part of the services but I prefer to
highlight it because of its potential. Take the service known as Business Process
Outsourcing (BPO). Here you get auditors, for instance, or accountants, people
that specialise in skills of bookkeeping and auditing. Auditors and accountants
that are based in Kampala, are able to work for companies in the United States
of America, Canada, Europe, etc., while they are physically here. How do they do
it? Work from abroad is sent to them over the internet, they handle the work as

```
12 • MANIFESTO 2026-
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
required and send the work back over the internet and they are, then, paid over
the International Payment System. A Country like India, earns USD 49.87 billion
from BPOs. Uganda can do well there.

**(4)** The fourth word I have been emphasising is **Jobs** _(emirimo)._ People talk
so much about jobs. The question is: "Where do jobs come from, mainly?" The
danger in Uganda is the colonial thinking on account of the distortions caused
by that phenomenon of colonialism. When the colonialists grabbed Uganda
from the incompetent and ego-centric chiefs, they completely distorted our
economy that provided full employment in the form of _emyooga._ There was
no phenomenon of the unemployed in the traditional society except for the
vagabonds _(ebirare)._ I even doubt whether the _biraare_ would be permitted to
survive in that no-nonsense society. Everybody had _omwooga_ which created
a job for him and jobs for others. You had: _Abaheesi_ (black smiths); _Ababaizi_
(wood workers); _Abakomagyi_ (bark cloth workers); _Abahazi_ (leather workers);
_Abariisa_ (livestock herders); _Abahiingyi_ (cultivators); _Abajubi_ (fishermen);
_Abariimbi_ (water transporters); Abagyengyi (surgeons); _Abashakyiizi_ (medical
workers); _Abafumu_ (foretellers); _Abahanuuzi_ (prophets); Abatanagyi (bow and
arrow makers); _Ababuunzi_ (hawkers); _Abarungaanwa_ (inter—zonal traders from
the coast); _Engabo_ (soldiers); _Abanogoozi_ (clay workers); _Abakama_ (rulers);
etc, etc.

When the colonialists took over Uganda, they wanted to kill the indigenous
providers of goods and services and annex Uganda's consumers to their colonial
system. Instead of, for instance, modernising those _emyooga_ (blacksmithing,
carpentry, etc.), they killed almost all the myooga and their products and
replaced them with imported products. Instead of endosho (wooden spoons),
they brought metallic spoons that are not comparable in safety. Instead of
_entatika_ (wooden plates) and _ebyaanzi_ that last for a very long time, they
brought clay plates and cups that break so easily and many times are made
from materials that turn out to be risky to health. Hoes, pangas, cloth, shoes,
etc., were imported, so was food (tinned milk and beef) from New Zealand try
to remote Ntungamo, maize flour from the White Farms in Kenya, butter and

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 13
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
jam from the United Kingdom, etc. So ridiculous but true. Instead, the colonies
were assigned the role of producing not food but beverages such as coffee, tea,
cocoa and other stimulants such as tobacco. How can you survive on beverages
and stimulants without food (carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins)? With these
basics, you had to import but concentrate on the peripheral.

```
Once the emyooga products were suppressed and replaced by colonial imports,
people massively lost jobs. The whole massive, elaborate and universal system
within the region (from the coast to the interior), based on barter trade
(kuchurika) and ensiimbi (cowrie shells currency), was destroyed and replaced
with imports from Europe such as Manchester textiles, Marekaani (American
textile), Japani (textiles from Japan). Therefore, the only category of jobs that
remained or was created was to work as auxiliaries for the colonial system, as
low-ranking soldiers, policemen, clerks, translators, etc. There were also a few
chiefs. Ankole had 55 Gombolola Chiefs, 10 Saza Chiefs and a few Co-ordinators
at the District Headquarters— Engaanzi/ Katikkiro (Prime Minister), Omuramuzi
(Judge), Omubikyi (treasurer) and Kihiimba (Head of the local civil service). This
was a total of 70 colonial jobs that the Banyankore colonial agents were fighting
over and dividing our people on a sectarian basis on account of these few jobs.
With this disruption of the ancient and elaborate economy, came the distortion
about jobs (emirimo) and business (money-making). Jobs (emirimo) became the
colonial clerical jobs (obwakaraani) — not the previous artisan jobs providing
for the needs of society; and money-making (business) was only confined to
the colonially demanded beverages and stimulants (coffee, tea, cocoa, tobacco,
etc). These were the cash crops, according to this distorted thinking. How about
bananas, cassava, millet, milk, beef, fruits, etc? No. These are just subsistence
products. Do not think about them, when it comes to money.
```
```
It is this colonial thinking about jobs and money—making (business), that is
disorienting our people. You ask somebody: "What job are you doing?" "Nokora
Kyl?" The answer: "I am not employed. I am just a farmer!!" Really; but being a
farmer is one of the best jobs.
```
```
14 • MANIFESTO 2026-
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
The NRM, therefore, from the beginning, saw through these colonial obscurantist
schemes. We saw the limitations of the small colonial economy of 3Cs and 3Ts
(coffee, cotton and copper and tea, tobacco and tourism), even when we restored
some of them. Our 10 -points programme, among other things, talked of building
an independent, integrated and self—sustaining economy, where everything that
is used nationally, regionally and internationally, that we can produce profitably,
can be a cash product (bananas, maize, cassava, milk, beef, fruits, millet, sorghum,
sweet potatoes, etc). We also rejected the status of being a mere supermarket
for imported products. Hence, the four sectors where wealth is found. These
are; commercial agriculture, manufacturing and artisanship, services and ICT. It
is, therefore, the wealth of an individual, a family or a company that creates jobs
for the owners and also for their employees. As we speak today, commercial
agriculture has already created 3,610,064 jobs, manufacturing 1,416,548 jobs,
services 5,042,188 jobs and ICT 46,172 jobs. This is just the beginning. As I said
elsewhere, the Nyakaana model where he has created 15 jobs in 1.3 acres, means
that if we only use seven million acres of the arable land of Uganda, we shall
create 105 million jobs. Therefore, the _Bazzukulu,_ do not kill yourselves over the
office jobs. Use the government programmes to go into commercial agriculture,
artisanship that is integrated with industry, services and ICT. The skilling hubs
and the technical schools, should ensure that the people they train have the
capacity to work in the mushrooming factories. I am told that the electricians
we need, the machine operators, etc., are not enough and many times we import
from other countries.

**(5) Services**

Here we need to talk about services not as just businesses for the owners or
the employees, but from the point of view of the consumer. I am a citizen or
a resident of Uganda. I need security from war. I need security from crime. I
need medical care. I need veterinary and crops advice. I need education for my
children. On account of our strong Army, Uganda is free from war. However,
there is a bit of crime partly encouraged and covered up by elements in the
Police and even some sections of the UPDF. We have already arrested some

```

```
of the traitors and we know all those involved, but we need more evidence to
conclusively act. They have been scaring away informers or even persecuting
them. The citizens must be firm. Report the criminals. Action will be taken. The
same applies to corruption. The corrupt try to infiltrate into the investigation
agencies to blind them by blocking and confusing the investigations. On the theft
of drugs in hospitals, we are working with our scientists on tracing these drugs.
They are confident that they have a solution. As we stop the theft of drugs, the
next pressure on our families is the cost of education in government schools.
In the coming term _(kisanja),_ we are determined to implement free education
for our children in government schools (primary, secondary and tertiary). The
good thing is that we have moved reasonably well on the expansion of the
education network. We now have 12,549 government or government-aided
primary schools, 1,416 government or government-aided secondary schools,
189 tertiary institutions and 10 government universities. It is through these that
we shall provide free education, our long-time held wish that some local groups
have been blocking. In the dialogue we had with them last, they promised to co-
operate. Apart from the government education network, there are the privately-
run schools. There are 32,653 private primary schools, 6,121 private secondary
schools, 115 private tertiary institutions and 68 private universities. There are
9,412,869 children in the government primary schools, 1,178,484 in government
secondary Schools, 30,171 students in government tertiary institutions and
111,598 students in government universities. The total enrollment of learners in
Uganda is currently 11,130,179 in the primary schools, 1,709,267 in the secondary
schools, 63,055 students in tertiary institutions and 220,000 students in the
universities.

We have been emphasising the study of science and technical studies, which
is paying off. You see what our scientists are doing in the areas of the electric
automobiles, vaccines, pharmaceuticals, etc. With service provision, therefore,
we are going to emphasise no stealing of government drugs, free education
for our young people in government schools, well-maintained tarmac roads,
using the Shs. 1.3 billion per district to maintain well the murram roads, uproot
the criminals within the security forces and continue to expand other services

```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
such as clean water, telephones, radio, etc. Before we conclude the point about
services, it is important to, again, note that with wealth at the individual, family,
or company level, you actually provide some of the services yourself. You can
go to a private clinic, pay for your child in a private school, drive yourself in
your own car, put solar power on your house, tap rainwater from the roof of
your house. That is why wealth creation is so crucial in the whole spectrum
of prosperity creation. Wealthy families even take away burdens of service
provision from the government.

**(6) Market**

It is amazing to see how many actors implement what is in the Church of Uganda
**_Prayer book on page 4 that says: "They left undone what they ought to have
done and did that they ought not to have done and there is no truth in them."_**
It is tragic to hear so called leaders — whether political, cultural, religious or
whatever else they are called, talking of tribes, religious sects in politics. _"If
you really love your people, do you wont them to be prosperous?" If they are_
to be prosperous through the sale of goods and services, who will buy those
products? Is the tribal market enough for your people's products? How useful
is religious sectarianism when it comes to markets? Do you want buyers for
your tribesmen or your religionmates? If whoever buys from you is good for
you, why, then, do you foment sectarianism among your potential customers?
It is, therefore, important that the NRM supporters understand and tell all and
sundry that in order to ensure prosperity for our people, we need, not only a
United Uganda to give market to our wealth creators, but also a United East
Africa and Africa. Hence, our four principles of Patriotism (love Uganda), Pan-
Africanism (love Africa), Socio-Economic Transformation and Democracy. All
Africans need to know the importance of a United African market. Why is the
USA prosperous and the nearby Latin America in misery yet Latin America has

be the fragmented market in Latin America. How easily can a business person
succeed in that fragmented market situation where the Continent is rich in the
number of Presidents and natural resources but poor in everything else? What

is our historical mission in Africa? Are we to build a United States of Africa in
Africa or a Latin America in Africa?

(7) The final word is Strategic Security. How can Africa be secure from all
threats? With economic integration, we unite the markets and create prosperity.
However, prosperity alone does not guarantee strategic security. A developed
Japan and a developed South Korea, still depend on others for strategic security.
In the 2rd World War, the developed countries of Holland, Denmark, Belgium,
France, etc., were overrun by Germany. It was the mighty Soviet Union and,
later on, the USA, that rescued those countries and the world. There is now the
phenomenon of some players seeking the 4 -dimensional superiority — to be
superior on land (Land forces), in the air (Air-force), at sea (the Navy) and in
space. Only four countries have been to the moon: the USA, China, Russia and
India. Can Uganda, even when it becomes a developed country, a task we are
already achieving, be able to be present in these four dimensions? My answer is:
"No". In order to be present in the four dimensions, Africa needs to rationalise its
political framework of excessive fragmentation. The AfCFTA (Africa Continental
Free Trade Area) will help to address, if it is implemented 100%, the issue of
prosperity. However, for strategic security, we need another medicine. This is
the medicine of political integration in the form of the formation of the East
African Federation, taking advantage of the similarities and linkages among the
people of this area, including the use of Swahili to unite us. It is what gives
us the seventh crucial word —the East African Federation, through political
integration.

The above are the seven words that we need to put uppermost in our heads.
(peace; development; wealth; jobs; service delivery; markets; and political
federation). This is how we come to our present intention of executing a
qualitative leap and transformation into a high middle-income status of USD
500 billion in the next few years. Why do we think that this is achievable? It
is because much of our USD 66 billion today by the exchange rate method, is
comprised of raw-materials. These include: unprocessed coffee, unprocessed
fruits, beef with little transformation other than just kubaaga (slaughtering),

```

```
grains such as maize, 10 million tonnes of unprocessed bananas, cassava,
forest products, etc, etc. By adding value to all these and also intensifying our
involvement in the knowledge economy, we shall attain the size of an economy of
USD 500 billion. The economy of the four sectors, will usher in socio—economic
transformation in society, leading to social metamorphosis. The old traditional
society of peasants, feudalists and artisans, already distorted by colonialism
in the form of killing the artisan class, will be replaced by a productive middle
class and a skilled working class.

I wish to end by congratulating all those that got elected as the new leaders of
the NRM. I am very happy to see that most of them are young. In order to succeed,
do two things. Do not try to carry the population under you on your head, but
simply lead them by showing them what to do and how, as you have been guided
by the NRM, using government money, not your personal money. Secondly,
concentrate on _okukyenuura_ (removing the removable needs) of the people by
showing them how to get out of poverty using government programmes such
as PDM, Emyooga, etc; implementing universal free education in government
schools in primary, secondary and tertiary institutions; stopping the theft of
government drugs in health centres; ensuring that the Police deal with crime
in your area; ensuring that the tarmac roads are always well maintained and so
are the murram roads; and ensuring that you fight land grabbing in your area.

```
I thank the masses of the NRM members across the Country, the Central
Executive Committee (CEC), the National Executive Council (NEC) and the
National Conference (NC) for supporting my candidature as NRM National
Chairman for 2026-2031 and Presidential flag bearer for the same period. I will
not let you down. We have got more capacity now than ever before.
```

I thank you all.

**PROFILE OF THE NRM**

**PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE**

President Museveni was born in September, 1944, to the Late Mzee Amos
Kaguta and the Late Esteeri Kokundeka in the pastoral heartlands of Ntungamo,
Western Uganda, during the tumult of the Second World War. His very name
(Museveni) - a tribute to the brave Abaseveni, Ugandan servicemen of the
King's African Rifles - foreshadowed a life dedicated to service, sacrifice, and
sovereignty.

```
In a community where colonial land policies and collaborator chiefs sowed
division and poverty, young Museveni witnessed firsthand the chains of
oppression that bound his people. These early experiences ignited a fire within
him: a profound commitment to dismantle injustice and uplift the marginalised.
```
From his school days at Ntare School in Mbarara, Museveni emerged as a
natural leader, captaining the debating society and Scripture Union. It was here,
in 1959, that he launched his first anti-poverty crusade among the Banyankole,
rallying kinsmen to abandon nomadism for sustainable livelihoods. This early
activism carried him to the University of Dar es Salaam, where, from 1967 to
1970, he immersed himself in the crucible of Pan-Africanist thought. Graduating
with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Political Science, Museveni co-
founded the University Students' African Revolutionary Front (USARF), serving
as its chairman and forging alliances with liberation icons like Julius Nyerere.
Mentored by progressive minds, he absorbed the anti-imperialist ethos that
would define his life's work: a belief that Africa's salvation lay in unity, self-
reliance, and the eradication of neo-colonial dependencies.

NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
Museveni's entry into Uganda's political arena was no accident of fate but a
deliberate stand against tyranny. As Idi Amin's brutal regime plunged the nation
into darkness after the 1971 coup, Museveni mobilized the Front for National.
Salvation (FRONASA), a vanguard force that allied with Tanzanian troops to
expel the dictator in 1979. In the fragile aftermath, he served as Minister of
Defence and Vice-Chairman of the Military Commission, only to witness the
rigged 1980 elections that restored Milton Obote's corrupt rule. Undeterred, on
February 6, 1981, Museveni ignited the flames of resistance with the National
Resistance Army (NRA), armed with just 27 guns and an unshakeable faith in
the people's will.

What followed was a five-year odyssey of ingenuity and endurance, a guerrilla
campaign without foreign bases or external patrons, rooted instead in the
grassroots support of ordinary Ugandans. On 26th January 26, 1986, the NRA
triumphantly entered Kampala, ushering in a new dawn. Sworn in as President
on 29thJanuary 29, Museveni inherited a shattered land: an economy in freefall,
tribal fissures deepened by vengeance, and institutions hollowed by decades of
dictatorship. True to his convictions, he assembled a broad-based government,
transcending ethnic and political divides to heal a wounded nation. Re-elected
decisively in 1996 (with over 75% of the vote), and reaffirmed in every poll since
(most recently in 2021), Museveni has shepherded Uganda through 40 years of
transformation, serving also as Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity
in 1990/91.

Under his stewardship, Uganda has evolved from a byword for chaos into a
beacon of stability and progress. His gaze extends beyond borders. He is a
pragmatic Pan-Africanist. He eschews the victim mentality and believes that
the African people are the architects of their own destiny. With this mantra, he
has contributed to regional peace. This has won him global admiration.

```
Museveni is the current Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and
has several priorities for NAM's agenda.
```
```

```
His transformative leadership has earned him prestigious recognition:

```
1) He was awarded the Global Peace Award, by the Global Peace Foundation
for his exemplary and democratic leadership.
```
```
2) He received the AfrikaVerein Award, for excellence in leadership from
the German Africa Business Association, making him the first African
president to receive this prestigious award.
```
```
3) On the 21st January, 2020, President Museveni received The African
Leadership Magazine Award, in London, in honour of his contribution to
the liberation struggles of Africa and good leadership skills.
```
```
4) He was also credited for leading a decisive battle against the Corona
Virus Pandemic in Uganda, by taking quick and bold measures to combat
its spread. The prestigious Lancet Medical Journal credited Uganda for
being among the 10 best countries in the world and the best country in
Africa, in responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
```
```
Museveni is happily married to Janet Kataha Museveni, with children and
grandchildren. He is a true patriarch not just to his immediate family, but
to the People of Uganda. He affectionately refers to young Ugandans
as his Bazzukulu (grandchildren), and they in turn refer to him as Jjajja
(grandfather). In Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, Uganda finds not just a leader,
but a liberator whose legacy is etched in healed divisions, a burgeoning
economy, and hopeful hearts.

**1 INTRODUCTION**

**1.1 Background**

The NRM believes in transparency and accountability, as the hallmarks of good
leadership. As we ask the people of Uganda to renew our political mandate, in the
new _kisanja_ (term of office), we must, first and foremost, give accountability for
the _kisanja_ of 2021-2026. Thus, in our Manifesto, we clearly show performance,
over the last five years, pointing out both the achievements and unfinished
business. We are concluding the _kisanja_ with an excellent scorecard, having
delivered on most of the promises which we made to the people of Uganda. In
the next five years, our efforts will be centered on the following:

1. Growing the Economy and Creating Wealth;
2. Infrastructure Development;
3. Human Development;
4. Democracy, Good Governance and Security; and
5. Regional Integration and Political Federation.
**1. Growingthe economy and creating wealth. How willthis goal be achieved?**
We will achieve it by ensuring that we completely eliminate spectators, in the
income-generation campaign. We want all energetic Ugandans to be players in
the money economy. A modern economy has two key players: the consumers
and the producers or wealth creators; and wealth is created by individuals,

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 31
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
families, companies, etc. Therefore, in the next five years, the NRM will boost the
wealth creation campaign, by mobilising all the Ugandan households to become
producers of either a good or a service, in order to increase jobs, incomes and
revenues for the government. We will not allow bystanders in the wealth
creation drive. The other catalyst for economic growth and development is
industrialisation. We will continue to invest in value addition in order to curb the
loss of money and jobs, on account of exporting raw materials. We will make
sure that products from Uganda are processed and of a high quality.

2. **Infrastructure development.** We will continue to improve and modernise
the social and economic infrastructure, across the country. Every part of Uganda
    has immense economic potential, if supplied with the necessary infrastructure
    i.e. roads, electricity, schools, hospitals, etc. Therefore, the NRM government
will continue to invest in infrastructure development, in order to guarantee low
costs of doing business i.e. cheap electricity, cheap transport, cheap internet,
etc. This way, our wealth creators will earn good profits to save and invest
    more.
3. **Human Development.** The NRM's initial sacrifice was to liberate the
    people of Uganda from oppressive regimes. After we succeeded in removing
the incompetent governments, we embarked on the mass programmes i.e.
    immunisation for all, education for all, to elevate Uganda's human resources.
This is how we have achieved the goal of a healthy and educated population. Our
focus is on building a more skilled and science-oriented labour force, to support
    manufacturing and innovation. Therefore, in the next five years, we will continue
to implement reforms in the school curriculum, at all levels, to ensure that our
    institutions of learning produce more job creators, rather than job seekers. We
will ensure that the school curriculum is aligned with the demands of the job
    market i.e. the private sector that needs engineers, electricians, science teachers,
doctors, nurses, etc. Uganda has a big pool of talent i.e. athletes, footballers,
    musicians, etc. The NRM government will continue to harness the talents of
our young people by building the sports infrastructure, supporting the talented
    men and women in the arts and creatives industry, etc.

```

PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
**4. Democracy, good governance and security. The democratic credentials**
of the NRM are unquestionable. We have continued to conduct periodic general
elections where the people exercise their constitutional rights to elect their
leaders. The power to hire and fire leaders lies with the people. We will continue
to uphold this gain. We also promise to continue protecting life and property,
fighting crime and impunity, and combating all threats to our peace and security.
**5. Regional integration and political federation. The visionary leadership**
of the NRM remains committed to the three historical missions i.e. prosperity,
security and fraternity of the African people. The three goals cannot be achieved
if Africa remains fragmented into the current 54 states. Each of these states have
neither big markets to support their people's prosperity nor military muscle to
defend their interests against a powerful predator from outside. Therefore, the
opportunity for guaranteeing the prosperity and security of our people lies in
building regional and political integration of Africa. The NRM will continue to
exploit the linkages and similarities among the African people to foster unity.

The NRM has defended Uganda with meagre resources, in the past. We now
have greater means and resources to keep away parasites and opportunists,
who imagine that they can reap from where they did not sow. The NRM has
put Uganda in an enviable position; and, therefore, there are many _kamunyes_
(carnivorous birds), with their mouths watering for Uganda's coffee, gold, timber,
iron ore and other riches. With the NRM at the helm of the Country's affairs,
Ugandans can be rest assured that their resources are safe; and that those
resources will be sustainably exploited, to create wealth and jobs, for everyone.
That is why the theme of this Manifesto is: 'Protecting the Gains.' It resonates
with the NRM's historical mission of guaranteeing Uganda's prosperity and
security.

```
Finally, we urge all Ugandans to read and internalise the wonderful programmes
outlined in the NRM Manifesto 2026-2031. Trust the NRM to protect your gains.

**1.2 Our Gains**

**1.2.1 Economic Gains**

Under NRM, economic stability is non-negotiable, particularly low inflation,
a stable exchange rate, and prudent fiscal and monetary policies which are
fundamental in a free-market economy. These have laid a foundation for the
following progress, in the last 5 years;

```
i) The size of the economy doubled, in spite of global shocks such as COVID-19
and disruptions in external markets. Real GDP has grown faster every year
(2020-2024) recovering from 3.0% in FY2019/20 to 6.3% in FY2024/25. As
a result, the economy expanded from Shs 128.5 trillion (USD 34.7 billion)
in 2019 to Shs 226.3 trillion (USD 61.3 billion) in FY2024/25. By the end of
the FY2025/26, the size of the economy is projected to expand to Shs 254.2
trillion (USD 66.1 billion);

```
```
ii) Uganda upgraded from a Least Developed Country (LDC) and will rise to be
one of the most respected countries. In March 2024 Uganda met the criteria
for graduation from the category of Least Developed Countries (LDCs)
thus Uganda crossing the lower middle-income threshold and setting the
foundation for continued socio-economic transformation. GDP per capita
```
```
34 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
```
increased from Shs 3.15 million (USD 891) in FY2019/20 to Shs 4.52 million
(USD 1,263) in FY2024/25 and is expected to increase to Shs 4.76 million
(USD 1,324) by end of FY2025/26;
iii) Ugandans are wealthier. Poverty declined from 21.4% in 2016 to 16.1%
in 2025, while the proportion of households engaged in the subsistence
economy fell from 68.9% in 2010 to 33.1% by FY2023/24. This is as a result
of the successful NRM financial inclusion programmes like the OWC, PDM,
Emyooga and other livelihood support programmes, discussed in detail
below;
iv) Income inequality has reduced. The Gini index (a statistical measure used
to determine the extent of inequality within a population) reduced to 38%
in 2024, from 41% in 2020 and 46% in 1994. Hence, the gap between the
richest person and the poorest is reducing contrary to popular belief;
```
v) Jobs are back after recovering from COVID effects and will continue to
increase. New jobs, which had contracted to 258,286 in FY2020/21 due to
Covid, have since recovered to 345,039 in FY2021/22, and are expected
to reach 399,083 by end of FY 2025/26. This is driven by recovery of the
service sector and the contribution to job creation by our wealth creation
initiatives. Informal sector employment rose from 9 million (FY2019/20)
to 10.5 million (FY2024/25), making up over 85% of the workforce and
contributing 51% of GDP. Public sector jobs expanded from 329,633 (2020)
to 366,574 (FY2024/25);

vi) The cost of living has been well managed as prices of basic utilities like
sugar, fuel, soap and salt have either remained unchanged or reduced.
NRM has a track record of prudent management of price stability which
has made Uganda one of the least costly and price predictable countries;

vii) The shilling has been the most stable currency in Africa. During the FY
2024/25 our shilling gained value as many other currencies lost theirs;

viii) Revenue collection doubled. The total revenue collected increased to Shs
32 trillion in FY2024/25 from Shs 17.6 trillion in FY2019/20;

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 35
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
```
ix) Driven by investments in industrial parks, the industrial sector continues
to grow. Factories have increased to an estimated 50,000 from 37,559 in
2019/20. Of these, 10,437 are formal of which 690 are located in industrial
parks;
```
x) Our exports are vibrant and as already mentioned getting more diversified
and sophisticated. Total export earnings from goods and services reached
USD 13.3 billion in FY 2024/25, of which USD 10.6 billion was earned from
export of goods only. Key exports included: gold (USD 4.2 billion); coffee
(USD 2.2billion); Manufactured products (USD 2.4 billion); Cocoa beans
(USD 620.4 million); milk products (USD 79.11 million); base metals and
products (USD 225 million); sugar (USD 202.2 million); fish and fish products
(USD 149.4 million); Ceramic tiles (USD 112.7 million); wood and ply wood
(USD 93.16 million); Plastic products (USD 61.03 million); tea (USD 54.68
million);maize (USD 97 million); Beans (USD 71.1 million); Flowers (USD
62.41 million); cement (USD 78.04 million); Fruits (USD 89.12 million); Soya
beans and groundnuts (USD 18.3 million)among others;

xi) Ugandans abroad continue to contribute progressively to our economy.
Remittances from Ugandans abroad reached USD 1.6 billion (Shs 5.76
trillion) in FY 2024/25, from USD 1.1 billion in FY 2020/21 at the start of the
_kisanja;_

xii) We have increased our capacity to power our industrialisation agenda and
connected more Ugandans to the grid. Electricity generation rose to 2,051
MW in 2024 from 1,839.4 MW in 2019, with completion of flagship projects
like Karuma, Isimba and other electricity generating facilities. As a result,
access to electricity increased to 60% of the population in 2024, up from
51% in 2019/20, driven by grid extension, solar solutions and last-mile
connectivity;

xiii) Tourists have renewed optimism. Tourism earnings have grown by 13.1
percent to USD 1.52 billion in 12 months to March 2025, from USD 1.36
billion during the same period in 2024. This impressive growth is attributed
to the sustainable peace, increased competitiveness of Uganda's tourism

```
36 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
```
industry and Government investment in strategic tourism infrastructure,
including Uganda Airlines;
```
xiv) In the past ten years, we have invested over Shs 11 trillion in key wealth
creation initiatives. These initiatives have contributed to poverty reduction
from 56.4% in 1992 to 16.1% in 2024 and cut the number of households in
subsistence economy by more than half from 68% in 2014 to 33% in 2024.
In addition, they facilitated value addition; empowered youth and women
to do business; and helped businesses to recover from economic shocks
including COVID 19.

**1.2.2 Socio-Political Gains**

NRM has invested in services that have improved the quality of life of the
average Ugandan, as exemplified below:

```
i) Ugandans are living longer and happier lives like never before. Life
expectancy at birth has improved to 68 years, from 43 years in 1986;
ii) Mothers are no longer dying from childbirth-related complications like
they used to. The overall Maternal Mortality Ratio has reduced by about
45% from 336 per 100,000 to 189 per 100,000 live births in the past 10
years;
iii) The number of children dying before their first birthday has significantly
reduced. Infant mortality rate has reduced from 122 deaths per 1,000 live
births in 1986 to 28 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024 (way below the
average of Sub-Saharan Africa of 42 deaths per 1,000 live births). NRM has
saved 94 lives for every 1,000 Ugandans born. Before the NRM, Ugandan
children were dying from common killer diseases such as Measles,
Polio, Tetanus, Whooping Cough, Tuberculosis (TB) and Diphtheria. Our
immunization efforts have eliminated these diseases;
```

```
```
iv) Malaria incidence reduced by 24% from 302 per 1,000 population to 230 per
1,000 population over the past five years and a 42% reduction in mortality
due to malaria from 5,050 deaths in 2020/21 to 2,917 deaths in FY 2023/24;
```
v) Through NRM's Universal Primary Education (UPE) programme, Ugandan
children are going to school. The national literacy rate has risen to 74% in
2024 from 43% in 1986. Enrollment in Government-aided primary schools
increased to 9.5 million learners by 2025, up from 2.5 million in 1996;

vi) The national road network is in better condition. The road network that
is tarmacked has increased to 6,288 kilometers from 1,000 kilometers in
1986 and 844 kilometers at independence;

vii) As a result of Ugandans becoming wealthier, they are living in better
houses. Between 2014 and 2024, Uganda's housing stock increased from
6.53 million units to 7.99 million units, with the proportion of households
living in grass-thatched houses decreasing from 37.6% to 25%. Thus, 75%
of households live in houses roofed by permanent materials such as iron
sheets, clay tiles, slates, etc. Similarly, brick-walled houses increased, from
5.20 million units in 2014 (54.8%) to 6.50 million units in 2024 (60.7%).
This indicates a progressive reduction in mud-and-wattle structures,
which reduced from 30.6% in 2014 to 21.2% in 2024, reflecting increasing
household incomes and access to durable materials. Flooring quality has
also improved. Households with cement floors increased from 2.64 million
units in 2014 (27.8%) to 3.34 million units in 2024 (31.2%). Over the same
period, rammed earth floors declined from 31.6% to 25.2%;

viii) Ugandans can now access safer and cleaner water. Currently, 68% and
71.6% of the population in the rural (within a walking distance of 500m)
and urban areas (within a walking distance of 200m) respectively, have
access to clean and safe water. At village level, the number of villages with
a safe, clean and affordable water supply system increased from 38,809
villages in 2021 to 57,313 villages out of 71,210 in 2025 which is now an 81%
coverage;
ix) Uganda is peaceful and stable.

**1.3 Unfinished Business**

The NRM has, over the past four decades, laid a strong foundation for Uganda's
stability, security, and socio-economic progress. However, the journey to a fully
transformed, modern, and prosperous Uganda is ongoing. We remain resolute
in our pursuit to transform Uganda into a modern, inclusive, and competitive
economy that works for all. In the next five years, we will focus on the following,
deepening our efforts to ensure no one is left behind:
i) Creating wealth for the remaining 33% of the households still in subsistence.
Three in ten families are either still stuck in subsistence farming and
not benefiting from the money economy or engaged in non-profitable
enterprises;
ii) Resolving land use rights, ownership and fragmentation that remain a
barrier to commercial farming and proper land use;
iii) Adding value to agriculture and minerals before exporting them. Currently,
we are donating 80% of our value and jobs to the rest of the world by
exporting raw materials;
iv) Development of tourism sites;

v) Investing in irrigation and fertilizer to stabilize agriculture and enhance
productivity. We are currently over relying on rain-fed agriculture and our
soils are depleted;

vi) Investing in science, technology and innovation to unlock industrial growth,
and increase productivity. Our economy is currently reliant on agricultural
raw materials, extractives, low value industrialization, and less complex
exports;

vii) Reducing the cost of doing business by increasing investments in the
transport infrastructure, reducing the cost of electricity and increasing
access to affordable, long-term capital to support private sector growth
and competitiveness;

viii) Constructing the pipeline for refined products to get the fuel tankers off
the roads;
ix) Completing the Standard Gauge Railway and rehabilitation of the Meter
Gauge Railway;

x) Reducing unemployment and underemployment among our young people
by increasing labour productivity, gainful employment, and skilling;

xi) Eliminating corruption in government and private sector;

xii) Increasing access to international and regional export markets such as the
EAC, COMESA and AfCFTA, by addressing tariff and non-tariff barriers;

xiii) Increasing domestic revenue mobilization to fund national priorities. Our
revenue to GDP ratio has stagnated between 13% and 14%;

xiv) Investing in our cities, including Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area with
modern infrastructure, affordable housing and other facilities or amenities;

xv) Investing in more industrial parks and export zones to increase
industrialization, create jobs, substitute imports and increase exports;

xvi) Investing in the creative arts industry, sports and talent development for
wealth creation and youth employment;

xvii) Expanding affirmative programmes to attain social equity and ensure no
Ugandan is left behind;

xviii) Enhancing quality of healthcare and education. On education, the issue is
charging parents fees in UPE and USE schools that are already funded by
government. In health, the issue is theft of medicines and absenteeism of
health workers; and

xix) Dealing with environmental degradation and climate change.

**GROWING THE ECONOMY**

**AND CREATING WEALTH**

**2.1 Growing the economy**

In the next five years, NRM's economic mission is clear: to double the size of
Uganda's economy, transform livelihoods, and turn every adult Ugandan into a
producer of a good or a service for sale. We will focus on generating more gainful
jobs, expanding wealth creation opportunities, and empowering Ugandans to
take charge of their economic destiny. The overall goal is full monetization of
the economy, with the following specific objectives:
i)
ii)
iii)
iv)
v)
vi)

```
Commercialization of agriculture;
Investing in manufacturing;
Adding value to minerals and oil & gas;
Developing tourism;
Investing in science, technology and innovation (STI) and ICT; and
Investing in young people with talents.
```
```
For these objectives to be realised, the NRM will continue to prioritise
macroeconomic stability and lower the cost of doing business by bringing down
the cost of electricity, internet, transport, and capital.
```
```

**2.1.1 Commercialisation of Agriculture**

NRM's onslaught on the subsistence economy has resulted in reducing the
number of Ugandans "working for only the stomach". Households in subsistence
in the different parts of the country, reduced to 33% in 2024 from 69% in 2014.
The target is to fully monetize all Ugandans. To achieve this, we will make it
cheaper and easier for Ugandans to get affordable, patient capital.

NRM will also continue to guide our people in enterprise selection. While some
of our people have joined the money economy (such as producing colonial
cash-crops), they have been doing it without ekibaro (without a cost-benefit
analysis). This poor enterprise selection leads to low returns and perpetual
poverty. Where households have adhered to NRM's wealth creation gospel,
they have transformed into successful homesteads.

This _kisanja_ is going to be dedicated, first to enrolling the remaining 33%
households still in subsistence to achieve full monetization of our economy,
and help those in the money economy without _ekibaro_ to select more profitable
enterprises.

NRM's protracted targeted investment in commercialisation of agriculture
along the value chain has yielded significant results. In the subsequent sections,
we elaborate what we are going to do to support all Ugandans engaged in
agriculture to commercialise. This we shall do by investing in the entire value
chain right from research to markets.

**a) Agricultural research**

NRM has over the years invested in crop and animal research thereby introducing
high-yielding and drought-resistant crop varieties, superior animal genetic
resources for breeding and improved technologies. For example, the National
Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) developed an anti-tick vaccine
which we have now commercialised. NARO has also developed agricultural
technologies such as water-saving cultivation technology; integrated pests,
disease and weed control technologies (for bananas, cassava, maize, rice,
potatoes etc.); anti-aflatoxin technologies; among others. NARO also produced
fast growing fish fingerling which have contributed to the growth of fish farming
in Uganda.

The National Coffee Research Institute (NaCORI) under the auspices of NARO,
has spearheaded research into wilt-resistant varieties of coffee which has
contributed to increased coffee production, productivity and export earnings.
We have also produced and availed to farmers countrywide fast-maturing
piglets.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Continue to fund NARO, NAGRC&DB and academic institutions to undertake
more research to provide farmers with improved planting materials and
breeds;
ii) Continue to support NARO to commercialise the anti-tick vaccine and
complete research on vaccines against Foot and Mouth Disease and Swine
Fever;
iii) Conduct soil testing across the country to provide crucial information
about soil fertility and nutrient levels, allowing farmers to optimize crop
production;

**b) Agricultural production and productivity**

The NRM through Operation Wealth Creation (OWC) laid a strong foundation
by supporting millions of households with planting materials and livestock. We
distributed a number of farm inputs for coffee, tea, sugarcane, cassava, maize,
fruits, livestock, fish, etc. In 2021, we started the PDM which now enables our
farmers to buy their own farm inputs. As a result of these efforts, Uganda is
now a surplus producer of these. For example, coffee production has increased

```

```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
to 8.2 million (60 kg bags) in the FY 2023/24 from 7.8 million (60 kg bags) in
FY2022/23. The volume of maize increased to 5 million tons in 2024 from 3.4
million tons in 2018. Fish volumes have also increased to 600 metric tons of
fish, while milk production increased to 5.4 billion litres making Uganda the
number one producer of milk in Africa.

```

```
(i) Water for production and irrigation
```
```
In order to stop over-reliance on rain-fed agriculture and stabilize agriculture,
NRM is prioritizing investment in water for production and irrigation. We have
invested in seven large scale irrigation schemes: Ngenge in Kween District;
Rwengaaju in Kabarole; Tochi in Oyam; Mubuku II in Kasese; Olweny in Lira;
```
```

are currently under construction. These are: Acomai in Bukedea District; Atari in
Kween/Bulambuli Districts; and Namatala, covering Budaka, Mbale and Butaleja
Districts.
```
```
Apart from large scale irrigation, NRM has also invested in solar-powered
irrigation for smallholder farmers across the country. In the past few years, we
have constructed over 4,300 micro-scale irrigation facilities, and 5,251 small and
medium-scale irrigation schemes in 135 districts across the country, benefiting
thousands of smallholder farmers.

It is key in raising agricultural productivity and reducing labour costs. We have
established zonal agricultural mechanisation centres in Namalere, Buwama,
Bunghokho, Agwata and Sanga to enhance farmers' access to modern farming
equipment. We have also procured and distributed hundreds of assorted
tractors and their implements to farmer groups countrywide. We have trained
thousands of youths and women as operators and mechanics. We also acquired
heavy earth moving equipment which is used for bush clearing and construction
of valley tanks/dams. These can be accessed by farmers at Subsidised rates.

**c) Post-harvest management**

To reduce post-harvest losses, NRM has constructed community grain stores,
distributed milk coolers and matching generators to dairy farmers, provided
maize and rice milling equipment to farmers' groups, and trained farmers in the
right post-harvest handling practices across the country.

**Our promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Work with the private sector or farmer cooperatives to provide post-
harvest technologies such as cold chain and packaging facilities for
horticulture. Where this is not possible, government will directly invest;
ii) Provide extension services to farmers in post-harvest handling;
iii) Ensure compliance with standards at harvest, post-harvest and storage;
iv) Establish a national sanitary and phytosanitary export training and
demonstration facility at Namalere.
```
**d) Adding value to agricultural raw materials**

Since colonial time, our hardworking farmers and other wealth creators have
been largely relegated to supplying raw materials for other nations' industries.
At the dawn of colonialism, Uganda's economy, for example, was structured
to be a producer of raw cotton, coffee, tea, tobacco, rubber and minerals for
Britain, and a market for Britain's manufactured products such as textiles,
instant coffee, processed tea, cigarettes, car tyres, electrical appliances, etc.

```
52 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
Our wealth creators have been donating a disproportionately large share of the
value of our coffee, cotton, tea, and minerals to other countries. When we export
raw materials, we donate money, jobs, foreign exchange, price stability, etc. to
the countries that add value to these raw materials. They reap the benefits of
our toil.

For example, last financial year (2024/25) we exported coffee worth USD 2.2
billion. This was largely raw coffee packed in 7.75 million 60-kg bags, translating
into 465,000 tonnes of coffee. The countries that bought our coffee paid USD
4.75 per kilo, on average. If we added value to this coffee before export, we
would have earned USD 30 per kilo.ln total, Uganda would have earned USD 14
billion from coffee last year.

Therefore, by exporting unprocessed coffee, we donated USD 11.8 billion to the
countries that bought it. On this, add the jobs we lost, the value our shilling
would have gained, the value of electricity that would have been used to roast
and package the coffee, etc. The USD 11.8 billion we donated through export of
raw coffee is equivalent to Shs 43.7 trillion. This is the money we needed last
year to finance our budget without borrowing, and with minimal taxation.

That is why the NRM has always been pushing for value addition to stop this
hemorrhage (the constant outflow of our resources). This is enshrined in Point
Number Five of our historical _Ten Point Program._ In the past four decades we
have made some good progress. Uganda is now self-reliant in, and an exporter
of some of the basic manufactured products such as soap, sugar, salt, cooking
oil, soda, beer, cement, steel, paper, etc. A few years ago, our country was a
net importer of these products. Last year we earned USD 963.7 million from
exports of value-added products. If exports of refined gold are added, the figure
balloons to USD 5.17 billion.

Therefore, our resolve is to intensify value addition during the 2026-2031 term.
This is not just an economic strategy; it is a patriotic duty. It is the most practical
path to creating sustainable jobs for our youth, boosting household incomes,

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 53
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
and securing our economic sovereignty.

```
NRM has over the years constructed a number of value addition facilities to
increase opportunities to enable farmers access high value markets. They
include facilities for processing coffee, fruits, cassava, sugar, and tea.
```
**Our Promise**

As already indicated in the section 1.3, this is part of NRM's unfinished business
that we are going to put emphasis on. To achieve the ten-fold growth, we
are going to invest more intentionally in value addition, in all agricultural raw
material before export.

**e) Increasing markets access for our wealth creators**

The NRM has always pursued a two-pronged strategy for enhancing market
access by our wealth creators. First, we are working to boost the household
incomes to enhance the purchasing power of Ugandans for expanded domestic
market. Taking milk as an example: Currently, each Ugandan consumes about
64.5 litres of milk per year. The World Health Organization (WHO), however,
recommends a per capita consumption of 200 litres. If say, 40 million out of our
46 million Ugandans could afford this recommended amount, we would need
8 billion litres of milk annually creating a huge demand that far exceeds our
current production of 5.3 billion litres. Increasing purchasing power will thus
unlock our domestic markets.

Secondly, we are deliberately promoting regional integration to access bigger
markets within the EAC, COMESA and AfCFTA. This is complimented by access
to duty free markets that we have negotiated with the EU, Britain, Russia, Serbia
and the Middle East. This explains why our exports have grown to USD 13.2
billion as at June 2025 from as low as USD 554 million in 1995. We currently
export over USD 2.8 billion within the EAC alone, rising from just USD 63 million
in 1999 when the EAC was restarted. This is a 44 -fold growth in regional exports,

```
54 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
despite the Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs) imposed on our exporters by some of our
trade partners. We have all heard stories of some of our key exports like milk,
sugar, eggs, maize, etc being banned from accessing markets of some of our
neighbours. They use NTBs such as rules of origin, standards, permits, etc. to
frustrate our exporters. Recently, even value-added products such as steel, and
ceramic tiles have faced levies and tariffs imposed by some EAC Member States
Ye t , to achieve ten-fold growth and socio-economic transformation, Uganda
needs regional markets. Theyare near us,fast growing in both size and purchasing
power, and the standards are easier to meet. For example, DRC alone is now
giving us USD 965 million. Kenya is giving us USD 702 million, South Sudan USD
586million, Rwanda USD 305 million, Tanzania USD 218 million and Burundi USD
67million. To this, add the USD 2.2 billion that we earn from COMESA and USD
199million from the rest of Africa. Therefore, out of the USD10.8 billion that
Uganda received from export of goods in FY 2024/25, USD 5 billion came from
Africa. This is why NRM has always pursued the correct strategic mission of
pan-Africanism and regional integration.

**Our promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Continue investing in our wealth creation initiatives to increase household
incomes and enhance the purchasing power for domestic demand;
ii) Fund our Missions abroad through the Economic and Commercial Diplomacy
(ECD) programme to promote our exports;
iii) Invest in standards, certification and market intelligence to enhance market
access;
```
```
iv) Establish border export zones with full logistics support to facilitate
seamless trade;
```
v) Negotiate more market access and ensure more market penetration to
the EAC, COMESA,AfCFTA, Middle East, EU, UK, Eastern Asia and America.
Emphasis will be put on removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers;

```

```
```
vi) Set up a National Marketing Company (NaMCO) to market agricultural
commodities locally, regionally and internationally;
vii) Operationalise the export guarantee scheme to de-risk and provide patient
capital to our exporters; and
viii) Continue establishing and maintaining our market infrastructure such as
cold storage, slaughter houses and general markets (including border
markets).
```
**2.1.2 Investing in Manufacturing**

Manufacturing stands at the heart of Uganda's economic renaissance, serving
as the main engine to propel our nation into a future of prosperity and shared
wealth. Since we captured power in 1986, the NRM has pursued manufacturing
to add value to our abundant raw materials, reduce import dependency, create
jobs, shield our economy from external vulnerabilities, and position Uganda as
a regional economic hub.

```
As a result of these efforts, Uganda's manufacturing sector has transformed
remarkably. Uganda is now a net exporter of goods that we used to import
such as soap, sugar, milk, salt, cooking oil, soda, beer, cement, steel, paper, etc.
In the past 15 years we have added another 31 new value-added products to
our export basket. Some of these include light manufactured products such
as steel, cement, ceramic tiles, pharmaceuticals, paper, processed foods, dairy
products, casein, cosmetics and textiles, among others.
```
```
Manufacturing now contributes 15.6% (equivalent to USD 9.6 billion) to our
GDP, USD 61.3 billion as at June 2025. Manufactured goods constitute of about
23% (USD 2.4 billion) of Uganda's total export of goods worth USD 10.6 billion.
It should be noted that by 1986, Uganda was not exporting any manufactured
good, instead it was importing almost everything it needed.
```

We are going to focus on taking the manufacturing sector to the next level by

**2.1.3 Adding Value to Our Minerals and Oil & Gas**

**a) Minerals**

Historically, our minerals have been exported in a raw form hence robbing our
country of significant amounts in foreign exchange earnings and jobs. This is
why the Chairman of the NRM revolution banned the exportation of minerals
in their raw form. As a result, there has been increased investment in value
addition to our minerals here at home. For example, companies have poured in
to add value to gold (10 refineries), iron ore (3 steel making factories), limestone
(4 cement factories), tin (1 tin smelting plant), ceramics factories, copper and
cobalt, uranium, and rare earth elements, etc.

We have also successfully explored more minerals including: gold in Buhweju,
Mubende, Namayingo, Bugiri, Amudat, and Zombo districts; uranium in Kabarole,
Buhweju and Sembabule districts; Rare Earth Elements in Bugweri district;
Graphite in Kitgum district; Base metals in Namisindwa and Amuru districts;
Wolfram in Kabale district; and Bentonite in Hoima District.

**Our promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Invest in quantification of all explored minerals to guide investors;
ii) Undertake further exploration to discover and fully exploit our mineral
potential;
iii) Capitalize the Uganda National Mining Company to invest in value addition
to our minerals in collaboration with the private sector;
iv) Develop bankable projects to attract private sector investment and
concessional financing;

vi) Ensure expeditious re-development of Kilembe Mines;

**f) Oil and Gas**

When NRM discovered oil, we started by investing in our scientists to lead
its exploitation. The goal was to ensure maximum return to the people of
Uganda. We were even ready to keep our oil in the ground until we had built
the necessary capabilities to lead its exploitation and regulation. We also set
up a robust institutional, legal and regulatory infrastructure that includes; the
Petroleum Authority of Uganda (PAU), Uganda National Oil Company (UNOC),
Uganda Petroleum Institute Kigumba (UPIK), and enacted several laws and
policies to safeguard our national interests.

We are now ready for the first oil with proceeds estimated at USD 2 billion
per year for the next 25 years from sale of crude oil. This money has
been ringfenced for investment in infrastructure and not for _cham_ cham
(consumption). In order to earn this revenue, we had to invest in the East
African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) and several other upstream projects. Even
before the first oil, a total of 47,682 Ugandans have secured jobs.

Our next phase is investment in the downstream projects to add value to
our oil and gas for both domestic consumption and export. These include: a
60,000-barrel per day refinery, a pipeline for refined products, storage terminals,
and a petrochemical industrial park. These investments are projected to create
a new economy worth an average of USD 5 billion per year.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
```
```
i) Complete the EACOP and pump out the first oil;
ii) Construct the National Oil Refinery to produce refined petroleum products;
iii) Develop the Kabalega Petrochemical Industrial Park and attract
investments to process oil by-products into finished products for the local
and export markets;
iv) Continue capitalising UNOC to invest in downstream projects including;
a 60,000-barrel per day refinery, a pipeline for refined products, storage
terminals, and a petrochemical industrial park;
```
v) Invest in a natural gas pipeline to transport gas from Tanzania to Uganda;

vi) Continue supporting local content in oil and gas sector;

vii) Undertake further explorationof oil and gas; and

viii) Develop bankable projects to attract private sector investment and

**2.1. 4 Developing Tourism**

To u r i s m has always been strategic for Uganda, earning the country foreign
exchange even at a time when the economy was in turmoil. With minimal
investment, the sector has grown to a net receipt of USD 1.6 billion in FY 2024/25.

NRM's strategy now is to leverage tourism as one of the anchor growth drivers
to turn Uganda into a USD 500 billion economy. This will be easy to achieve by
increasing the number of tourists that visit Uganda, their length of stay, and
their average spend.

**2.1.5 Investing in Science, Technology and Innovation (STI), and ICT**

**a) STI**

The future of Uganda's economy and our ability to achieve a qualitative leap
into high middle-income status, lies in finding and investing in new sources of
growth and new technologies. We are deliberately committed to supporting
our scientists to develop the capacity to take full advantage of the massive
global knowledge economy and achieve ten-fold growth.

In the last _kisanja,_ we made remarkable strides in laying the groundwork for a
robust science and technology ecosystem. Our focus has been on promoting
local innovation and fostering a culture of scientific thinking. We have enhanced
salary for scientists, invested in scientific research and funded commercialisation
of science innovations to kick-start the building of a home-grown knowledge
economy. As a result, new innovations have been commercialised; electric
vehicles by Kiira Motors, vaccines and pharmaceuticals by Dei Biopharma,
Natural Therapeutics by Jena Herbals (Prof Ogwang), anti-tick vaccine by NARO
and vaccines by Alfasan. We have also supported academic institutions and
independent private sector to make their contributions to STI advancement.

**Our promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Support commercialisation of market-ready innovations;
ii) Invest more in scientific research and innovation;
iii) Invest in the development of the Hi-tech City to attract private sector
investment in technology and innovation;
iv) Establish science and technology parks;
```
v) Strengthen intellectual property (IP) framework to protect innovations;

```

```
vi) Revise and enhance the curricula at all levels to emphasise Science,
Te c h n o l o g y, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM);
vii) Expand our capacity for STI incubation;
viii) Increase EV charging infrastructure and E-Bus transit hubs;
ix) Complete the upgrade of Mpoma Earth Station to support weather
forecasting, land mapping, and disaster prevention; and
x) Modernise indigenous herbal medicine to make it commercially viable.
```
**b) Information and Communication Technology (ICT)**

```
ICT is both an enabler and a growth driver to the modern economy. It is one
of the fastest growing sectors since its liberalization. The NRM strategy is
to develop the ICT as one of the main sectors of the economy to employ
our young people, digitise businesses and the economy, and complement our
security efforts. In recent years, we have invested, and continue to invest in
expanding the National Backbone Infrastructure (NBI) to provide affordable
internet access.
```
With this, we have seen emergence of a new economy characterised by:
e-commerce, mobile telephony and associated businesses such as mobile
money, online broadcasting, the app industry, social media, business process
outsourcing (BPO), tele-medicine, tele-education, tele-conferencing, online
banking,etc. The adoption of ICT has also enabled Government to become
more efficient by cutting bureaucracy and corruption. The sector has created
jobs particularly for young people and promoted business. For example, the
BP0 industry alone has so far generated an estimated 25,205 jobs and our
target is to create another 150,000 jobs in the coming _kisanja._

```
In the past five years, the cost of internet has significantly reduced by 50% to
$35 per Mbps in 2024 from $70 per Mbps in 2018.The speed of internet has also
significantly improved ranging from 2nd generation (2G) to 5th generation (5G)

which currently is the latest and fastest. The mobile phone network coverage
is at 89% countrywide. The country now has 66 televisionand 293 FM radio
broadcasters respectively. The number of smart phones has increased to 18.2
million in 2024 from 7.6 million in 2020.

ii) Continue reducing the cost of internet to make it affordable to all Ugandans
particularly our young people;
iii) Invest in BPO zones, ICT innovation hubs, and tech parks;
iv) Spearhead the digitisation of government service delivery systems;
```
v) Invest in more ICT core infrastructure including data centers, high-power
computing centers, and specialised labs, intelligent Information systems
for traffic;

vi) Strengthen cyber security across all sectors of the economy;

vii) Expand public Wi-Fi in GKMA, regional cities, other peri-urban areas;

viii) Establish smart classrooms nationwide and fully connect education
institutions to Wi-Fi; and
ix) Negotiate with social media tech-giants to enable our young people to
monetise their content.

**2.1. 6 Invest in Young People with Talents**

The creative industry is not only for entertainment but also a powerful emerging
economic sector. It entails a wide range of activities, including visual arts,
performing arts, literature, music, film, fashion, design, crafts and sport. The
global market value of the entertainment industry stood at USD 466 billion in
2024 and is projected to grow to USD 860 billion by 2030. On the other hand,
the global sports market value is estimated at USD 417 billion with a forecast to
reach over USD 600 billion by 2030.

In Uganda, the entertainment industry contributes over Shs 270 billion to GDP
and it is projected to grow and become one of the top employers and wealth
creation sources. This is on account of Uganda's favourable demographics,
changing consumption patterns, increase in disposable incomes and increase in

```
72 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
the propensity to spend on leisure, entertainment and sport.

We have finalized discussions with our young people and their representatives
on how to effectively and sustainably support the wealth creators in the
creatives and sport sub-sectors. We have started with some investments in this
industry to grow it and conquer the region and beyond. In the past one year, we
have focused our efforts on addressing three key issues that the stakeholders
identified. These are:
i) Copyright infringement to stop unauthorised use and sale of our young
people's intellectual property without compensating them;
ii) A revolving fund for artists to liberate them from money lenders;
iii) Purchase of a home for creatives to serve as a common-user facility and "a
hollywood of Ugandan artists".
We have also made significant investments in sports infrastructure to promote
our young talented athletes. In preparation for CHAN and AFCON27, NRM is
investing over Shs 1.42 trillion for the construction of Hoima and Akii Bua Stadia,
as well as the associated training facilities across the country. In addition, NRM
has upgraded the Mandela National Stadium to international standards and
completed the National High-Altitude Training Centre-Teryet in Kapchorwa.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Enforce the Copyright & Neighbouring Rights law to protect our young
people's art and creations from unauthorised use and sale without
compensating them;
ii) Provide more money to capitalise the revolving fund for artists;
iii) Furnish the newly purchased home for artists with recording studios and
other related amenities;

vii) Continue to invest in modern sports facilities;

viii) Ensure AFCON 2027 is a success; and

```
ix) Provide a conducive environment for private sector investment in sports
academies.
```
**2.2 Creating Wealth**

NRM's commitment to wealth creation and socio-economic transformation
cannot be over emphasised. We know the importance of balancing the investment
in development and facilitating families to create wealth for themselves and
for the country. The tendency has been to emphasise development and not
wealth creation. The NRM has rectified this mistake by promoting development
anchored on wealth creation. Right from the beginning of our resistance
movement, we opposed trading off investment in wealth creation in favour of
observable infrastructure and education and health. The NRM believes the two
(development and wealth creation) go hand-in-hand.

That is why even when the country had very little money to meet so many
urgent socio-political and economic demands including securing the country,
tarmacking roads, building dams, providing free education and health etc., the
NRM initiated programmes to support Ugandans to create wealth and get out
of poverty. Programmes such as PAPSCA, PAP, _Entandikwa, Bonna Bagagawale,_
NAADs, OWC, etc. were implemented at a time when the budget was highly
constrained, but they made a difference. As more revenues have been generated
so has our expansion of wealth creation. The total amount of money that has
been invested in PDM alone is more than all the earlier efforts combined (Shs

```
74 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
4.4 trillion). This is more than Uganda's total budget in FY 2006/07 of Shs 4.1
trillion.

In the past ten years, we have invested over Shs 11 trillion in key wealth
creation initiatives. Some of the key wealth creation initiatives include: Uganda
Development Bank (Shs 1.9 trillion), the Parish Development Model (Shs 4.4
trillion by end of FY 2025/26), Emyooga (Shs 760 billion), the Youth Livelihood
Programme (Shs 207.95 billion), the Small Business Recovery Fund, (Shs 100
billion), the Agricultural Credit Facility (Shs 463 billion), the Youth Venture
Capital Fund (Shs 12.5 billion), Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Programme
(Shs 168 billion), the INVITE Project for export guarantee scheme (Shs 800
billion), the GROW Project for women in business (Shs 824 billion), and Uganda
Development Corporation (Shs 1.4 trillion).

**2.2.1 The Parish Development Model**

As promised in our manifesto 2021-2026, the Parish Development Model (PDM)
has been implemented in all the 10,589 parishes of the country. The PDM is the
first mass wealth creation programme, reaching every corner of the country
in the same fiscal year. It is spearheading Uganda's economic transformation
agenda by igniting entrepreneurship, fostering innovation, and unlocking the
potential of every household to evolve from subsistence and thrive in a rapidly
evolving economy. Under the financing pillar of the PDM, Government provides
a grant of Shs 100 million annually to each Parish to capitalize the Parish
Revolving Fund (PRF). This targets the households outside the money economy
selected by the parish members themselves.

After each household has benefitted and made repayment, the PRF will grow
and enable repetitive borrowing by household beneficiaries to sustainably
solve their financial needs. The continued annual government capitalization
and repayments into the PRF will create an adequate financial base for a PDM/
Cooperative Bank to evolve.

In line with NRM's historic mission of inclusivity, every special interest group
has a share in the PDM fund. Allocation of the Shs. 100 million per parish per
year is based on the following sharing criteria:
i) Women 30%
ii) Youth 30%
iii) PWDs 10%
iv) Elderly 10%

v) Others 20%

In total, 4.1 million households have benefitted across the country. The
beneficiaries have invested in the following: livestock such as piggery, goats,
cattle, sheep and poultry (48%); food and cash crops such as coffee, tea, maize,
cassava, onions, bananas and irish potatoes (45%); other enterprises (7%).
These investments are changing the lives of Ugandans by boosting household
incomes, enhancing food security and creating employment opportunities at
local levels countrywide.

**2.2.2 Emyooga and Other SACCOs**

For Ugandans outside agriculture and working in specialised enterprises, the
NRM promised to provide Shs. 100 billion each year as seed capital. Emyooga
funding targets 18 groups: carpenters, salon owners, taxi operators, restaurant
owners, welders, fishermen, market vendors, boda-boda, women entrepreneurs,
youth leaders, persons with disabilities, produce dealers, mechanics, tailors,
journalists, performing artists, veterans, and local elected leaders.

```
So far, we have provided Shs 660 billion and this has benefited 2.4 million
Ugandans, kick-starting a new local economy in value-added enterprises. NRM
has provided an additional Shs. 100 billion for Emyooga SACCOs and Shs 48.5
billion for other SACCOs this financial year (2025/26).
```
**2.2.3 Agriculture Credit Facility**

```
As part of NRM's efforts to support farmers' access to affordable financing
for commercialization of agriculture and agricultural value addition, Shs 413.4
billion has been injected in the Agriculture Credit Facility (ACF) since 2010.
This will increase by an additional Shs 50 billion by the end of June 2026. The
ACF is accessed through participating financial institutions which match the
Government contribution by 50%. This facility had provided over Shs 1.23 trillion
at 12% per annum interest rate by the end of June 2025. The maximum tenure is
8 years, including a grace period of up to 3 years. The terms and conditions of
the participating financial institutions hold. The ACF has so far supported 14,336
beneficiaries, of whom 3,531 are smallholder farmers.
```
**2.2.4 Interest-Free Loans for Commercial Farmers**

```
To further avail affordable credit in the agricultural value chain, the NRM, in FY
2025/2026, introduced an interest-free credit facility for large-scale commercial
farmers. The facility, which has started with Shs. 175 billion, can be accessed
through the three government-owned commercial banks (Post Bank-now Pearl

Bank), Housing Finance Bank and Pride Bank Limited).
```
**2.2.5 Uganda Development Bank**

In order to avail affordable long-term capital to support manufacturing,
commercialization of agriculture, acquisition of appropriate technologies
to increase productivity and development of the service sector, NRM has
cumulatively capitalized Uganda Development Bank (UDB) with Shs 1.9 trillion.
This has enabled the following achievements:

```
i) 607 businesses engaged in commercial agriculture, agricultural value
addition, manufacturing, tourism and hospitality, education, health services,
creatives, and construction industry, as at end December 2024 have been
supported.
ii) These businesses have created 55,553 jobs and generated an output value
of Shs 20 trillion, contributed Shs 944.2 billion in taxes, generated an
equivalent of Shs 3.3 trillion in forex earnings, and Shs 3.15 trillion in profits
for the private sector businesses supported.
iii) Implemented special programmes targeting small and medium enterprises
(SMEs), and youth- and women-owned businesses engaged in wealth
creation.
```
We have provided an additional Shs 1 trillion to further capitalize UDB.

**2.2.6 Small Business Recovery Fund**

The Small Business Recovery Fund (SBRF) fund was established in FY 2022/23
with an initial capital of Shs 100 billion to support small businesses which were
affected by Covid-19 to recover. This has been matched by commercial banks
and other financial institutions with another Shs 100 billion at an interest rate
of 10% per annum. The funding from the SBRF has enabled 3,496 micro, small
and medium enterprises to recover from the effects of Covid-19, saving over
26,672 jobs in the sectors of trade and commerce, hospitality, education and

**2.2.7 Growth Opportunities and Productivity for Women Enterprises**

In order to support women entrepreneurs, NRM, through the Growth
Opportunities and Productivity for Women Enterprises (GROW) Project, is
investing Shs 802.9 billion as seed capital for women in business. This money is
intended to facilitate women engaged in informal businesses to graduate into
the formal sector.

This fund has been brought closer to the beneficiaries as follows:

a) Northern region: Centenary Bank, Post Bank, DFCU Bank, Pride MFI, Koch

To support our exporters and further grow the economy, the NRM has created
an export guarantee scheme with initial capitalization of Shs 800 billion. This
facility is accessed by manufacturers with orders in external markets and those
that wish to expand their export-oriented operations, but lacking the requisite
capital. This fund is part of the Investment for Industrial Transformation and
Employment (INVITE) project. NRM's intent is to create more productive jobs in

**INFRASTRUCTURE**

**DEVELOPMENT**

Our mission as NRM is socio-economic transformation of the Ugandan society.
To achieve this, one of the key enablers is infrastructure. You cannot develop
a country without roads, electricity, water, railway and ICT. Investment in
these is a precursor to economic growth and development. The Uganda we
are building must be well connected, fast moving, and adequately powered. The
NRM is committed to developing all modes of transport, energy and ICT. In the
past we have committed substantial resources to infrastructure development
and made good progress in closing the gap. In the coming _kisanja,_ we commit
to invest more in infrastructure development as an enabler for wealth creation.

**3.1 Transport Infrastructure**

Constructing a road or a railway through any village automatically stimulates
economic development. On account of proper prioritisation, NRM has been
able to connect the entire country with tarmac roads from the North to South,
and East to West, despite the little money that the country had and the many
expenditure needs. Why? Because NRM has historically used the strategy of
_kamu kamu gwe muganda_ (one by one makes a bundle).

After solving the problem of insecurity, at the beginning of 2008, we increased
the budget of roads to Shs 1.08 trillion for the first time in the history of
Uganda. This was in response to our Chairman's 2006 directive, "henceforth,
it will be electricity and roads first and the rest later". This was the beginning

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 85
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
of prioritisation of roads and electricity, and hence the progress we have
made in closing the gap.

Our road network has tremendously expanded and improved from 1,000 km
of tarmac roads in 1986 to 6,306 km as at June 2024. This does not include city
roads and the over 1,135 km of roads under construction. We have also spent
a total of Shs 1.4 trillion on maintaining our tarmac roads during the past five
years. In the last Manifesto (2021— 2026), the NRM promised and has completed
the following roads totaling 1,185.5 km:

14. To m a t o Sauce Community drainage

In the cities, to deal with traffic congestion arising out of the gridlock generated
by roundabouts and junctions, we have installed traffic signal-controls. For
example, we have installed 66 traffic signal-controls in Kampala that have a
new Traffic Control Centre with capacity to coordinate up to 256 junctions.

**d. District, Urban and Community Access Roads (DUCAR)**

**NRM** prioritised rehabilitation and maintenance of our feeder roads commonly
known as DUCAR. These represent 87% of the total road network in Uganda. In
2016, we bought road construction equipment from Japan and distributed a full
set to each district, except the newly created cities. The equipment included;
graders, wheel loaders, excavators, bulldozers, wheeled backhoe loaders,
rollers, tractors, water bowsers, self-loading trucks, mobile workshops and
bitumen distributors.

We have also allocated funds for road maintenance in each and every district.
In the past five years alone, Shs 991 billion was allocated to districts to grade,
pour murram and compact our district and community roads. Starting 2023,
we increased the budget for road maintenance in Local Governments by Shs
1 billion per district/city/municipality, per year bringing the total to Shs 176
billion. It is surprising, that the state of these roads has instead deteriorated in a
number of districts. Where has this money gone? As we can all see, the problem
now is corruption in Local Governments which we are going to deal with.

**Our promise**

```
NRM will:
```
```
i) Prioritise maintenance of our tarmac and murram roads;
ii) Complete construction of roads, expressways, bridges and drainage as
indicated in tables 3, and 10.
iii) Complete rehabilitation of roads as indicated in table 4 above;

x) Expand street lighting by installing more lights and traffic-control signals
in Kampala, regional cities and municipalities.

**3.1.1 Railway Transport**

Railway transport is an integral part of economic development. It lowers
transport costs, freight movement, fosters regional development, attracts
investment, creates jobs and reduces environmental pollution. The NRM
strategy is to build an efficient rail transport system by refurbishing the existing
Meter Gauge Railway (MGR) and constructing a new Standard Gauge Railway
(SGR). This will transform Uganda from being a landlocked to a land-linked
country. The railway is going to help us to cut the cost of transporting cargo by
half, thereby reducing the cost of doing business. It will also remove the cargo
from our roads hence increasing their lifespan, and reducing congestion and
accidents. This will make transport in Uganda more competitive and safer.

In the past Kisanja, we have progressed in rehabilitating the Metre Gauge Railway
from Malaba to Kampala, and from Tororo to Gulu. We have purchased four
mainline locomotives and refurbished wagons to facilitate cargo transportation.
We have revived passenger commuter train from Kampala to Mukono, and plans
are underway to extend it to Jinja.

Construction of the SGR to connect Malaba to Kampala (272km) has started.
The SGR is a very strategic investment for our country. It will not only cut cargo
transport cost by half to USD 60 from the current USD 120 per ton, it will also
help us to reduce transit time from Mombasa to Kampala from 7 days to 1 day.

```
v) Construct a light rail mass transit system to reduce traffic congestion
and the cost of public transport in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan
Area;

vi) Construct a 60 km railway spur from the Majanji Port to Tororo.

**3.1.2 Water Transport**

```
Water transport is the cheapest and oldest mode of transport, yet underutilised.
Now that our revenues have improved, and we have addressed security and
other critical challenges, investment in water transport will be one of our
priorities. We have progressed in modernising Port Bell and Jinja pier, improved
navigation safety and security on water, repaired our ferries and acquired new
ones, and progressed with the construction of the Bukasa Port.

**3.1.3 Air Transport**

NRM recognises the importance of air transport particularly for a landlocked
country like Uganda. That is why we revived the national airline which our new
liberalists had mistakenly appraised on commercial terms and recommended
its closure. Since the revival of Uganda Airlines 5 years ago by our visionary
Chairman, Uganda's connectivity has improved within the continent, the
Middle East, Asia and the United Kingdom. The airline is now flying directly
to 17 destinations, which has contributed to reduced travel time for our
exporters, tourists, and other wealth creators, more so at affordable cost.

The competition brought about by our airline has forced other regional
airlines to reduce the cost of air tickets. For example, a return airticket to
Nairobi has stabilised at about USD 400, compared to USD 800 in 2019.The
national airline is now the largest operator and has 24% market share of
all air travel out of Entebbe Airport, up from 4% in 2019. Its revenue has
increased to Shs 411 billion in FY 2023/24 from Shs 28 billion in FY 2019/20.
With increased capitalisation and acquisition of additional aircrafts, the
airline will increase efficiency and enable travellers to and from Uganda to
enjoy direct and cheaper travel to more destinations.

On infrastructure development, we have invested in a number of strategic
areas including; building new airports, upgrading and expansion of existing
airports, and expanding air cargo transport.

We have constructed 2 new international airports in Hoima and Kidepo in
Karamoja with our friends from Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. We are also
developing aerodromes in Arua, Gulu, Pakuba, Jinja, Kisoro and Kasese to
promote internal travel, trade and tourism.

**3.2 Energy for Sustainable Growth**

Investment in energy is one of the fastest ways to transform a society and
reduce poverty. If you want to develop a village, connect it to electricity. In
1986, Uganda was generating only 60 megawatts (MW) of electricity out of
the installed capacity of 150 megawatts. Only a few towns had electricity and
it was extremely unreliable. We embarked on a mission to generate, transmit
and distribute electricity to all parts of Uganda.

We started by refurbishing the old dam in Jinja and then embarked on building
new dams to generate more electricity. We have since built Kiira dam,
supported private sector to build Bujagali dam, and recently, we invested
heavily in Karuma and Isimba dams. Today we are generating 2,052 Megawatts
of electricity which have enabled us to connect our growth centers, cities,
towns and villages to electricity. All districts, cities and municipalities are
now connected to the national grid, except Buvuma and Obongi. When we
came to power, only half the districts were connected to the electricity. For
the first time in our history, West Nile is also connected to the national grid.
Apart from the large dams, the NRM has worked with the private sector to
build small power plants to enhance access to electricity. Some of the new
power plants that we have commissioned include: Kigwabya Hydropower
Plant (4.2 MW) in Kagadi district; Xsabo Nkonge Solar Plant (20 MW) in Gomba
district; Pro Industries Co-generation Plant (4.3 MW) in Gulu district; and Off-
grid solar systems: 400 kWp on Bussi Island in Wakiso district among others.

In the outgoing _kisanja,_ our emphasis has been on building transmission
lines to evacuate our power from Karuma and Isimba dams. We completed
and commissioned nine transmission lines totaling 1,038.3 km. These are;
Karuma-Kawanda, Karuma-Olwiyo, Karuma-Lira, Namanve-Luzira, Mutundwe-
Entebbe, Opuyo-Moroto, Gulu-Agago, Kole—Gulu—Nebbi—Arua and Mirama-
Kabale. A further 880 MVA transformation capacity was added to the grid after
commissioning nine new substations. This has brought the cumulative total of
transmission lines to 5,140 km up from 2,354 km in 2019/20.

We are on track to achieve our target of 80% access to electricity by 2040.
Our current mission is to reduce the cost of electricity for manufacturers to 5
U.S cents per kWh. When we bought out Umeme, the electricity tariff for extra-
large manufacturers reduced to 5.5 from 8.8 U.S cents per kWh in 2023.
```
The 622 large and 52 extra-large factories we have in the country consume
half of the electricity, while all the 2.4 million domestic consumers use only
23%. As we can all see, when we invest in more factories and fully utilise the
capacity of the existing ones, the current electricity we generate will not be
enough. In addition, as we enter into the knowledge economy, the demand for
electricity will increase exponentially to power e-mobility, the SGR, monorails,
etc. Therefore, we need to generate more electricity for our tenfold growth and
socio-economic transformation.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Construct more electricity generation plants including; Buyende Nuclear
Power Plant (8,600 MW), Kiba Hydropower Plant (400 MW), Solar Power
Plant (500 MW), Wind energy systems (70 MW);
ii) Invest in renewable sources of energy particularly in areas where it is very
expensive to extend the national grid;
iii) Complete electrification of industrial parks, free trade zones, mining sites,
tourism sites;
```
```
iv) Invest in more energy transmission infrastructure;
```
v) Continue to capitalize UEDCL to further reduce the tariff cost; and

vi) Rehabilitate and refurbish our existing energy transmission and distribution
infrastructure to improve grid reliability.

**3.3 Affordable Housing**

The socio-economic transformation principle of NRM has led to rapid
urbanisation. As we educated the _Bazzukulu_ (young people), they emigrated
to towns and cities _en_ masse, looking for jobs and business opportunities. The
latest National Population and Housing Census revealed that Ugandans living in
urban areas have increased to 17.5 million in 2024 from 7.4 million in 2014. As
we can see, in 10 years the urban population has increased by 10 million. These
need affordable and livable housing.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Purchase land, develop it with the requisite infrastructure (roads,
electricity, water, internet etc.) and allocate it to private developers to
construct affordable houses;
ii) Capitalise Housing Finance Bank to reduce the cost of mortgages; and
iii) Capitalise National Housing and Construction Corporation to build
affordable houses.

**1 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT**

The NRM government has continued to prioritize investment in education,
healthcare, water, sanitation and environment. A country cannot
transform without the state investing in its people. Below, we give
accountability of what we have done and what we commit to do in the coming
term, to further improve the lives of Ugandans, by providing them with quality
education, improved healthcare and clean and safe water.

**4.1 Education**

The NRM recognises education as a fundamental human right and a great
social equaliser. Apart from equipping Ugandans with skills required to secure
employment, education enables our people to live longer, happier and affluent
lives.

**4.1.1 Primary Education**

When NRM came to power in 1986, education was only for those who could
afford to pay school fees. The children of the poor were left out of the education
system. In 1997, we abolished the charging of school fees in government-
aided primary schools; and introduced Universal Primary Education (UPE). As
a result, the number of children, enrolled in primary schools, has increased to
9.52 million learners, from 2.5 million in 1997.

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 121
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
The government has built and grant-aided more schools, raising the number
of government-aided primary schools to 12,549 as at June, 2025, from 6,880 in

1997. Today, 6,429 parishes out of 10,584 parishes, have at least one government-
aided primary school. In the last 5 years, we have also constructed 2,228 new
classrooms, renovated 794 classrooms, provided 21,004 desks (3-seater); and
    built 239 primary teachers' houses.

We have recruited more teachers, raising the number to 147,176 in 2025, from
84,825 in 1997 where we started UPE. Subsequently, the pupil-teacher ratio at
primary level has improved to 64:1 in 2025. Our target is to reduce it further
to 53:1. We have bought more textbooks and other instructionAL materials
for primary school learners. In the past five years alone, a total of 2.45 million
copies of science and social studies textbooks, along with 39,000 corresponding
teachers' guides, were distributed to government-aided primary schools.

These efforts account for the rise of the national literacy rate to 74% in 2024,
from 43% in 1986.

**4.1.2 Secondary Education**

In 2007, the NRM introduced free Universal Secondary Education (USE), to
enable children whose parents were unable to pay fees after UPE to continue
with their education. This is in line with our commitment to ensuring equitable
access to quality secondary education for all Ugandans. In 2012, we introduced
the Universal Post 0' Level Education and Training (UPOLET). The total number
of learners in government-aided secondary schools has increased to 1.14 million,
up from 412,367 in 2006. This is on account of our policy of free secondary
school education.

We have since built more secondary schools, recruited teachers and provided
learners and teachers with essential learning and instructional materials
aligned to the new lower secondary curriculum. The number of teachers has
also increased to 37,486, from 29,713 in 2007 when USE started.

```
122 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
In the last five years, we constructed 189 new seed secondary schools and
grant-aided 46 community secondary schools. The number of government-
aided secondary schools, in the country, has thus increased to 1,594 in 2025,
from 1,359 in 2020. Another 258 seed secondary schools are at various levels of
construction. The NRM has been able to increase the number of sub-counties/
town councils with at least one government aided secondary school to 1,147
out of 2,191 sub-counties/town-councils in Uganda.

MANIFESTO 2025-2031 • 123
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
The NRM has provided free learning and instructional materials for government-
aided secondary schools to support implementation of the new lower secondary
curriculum. In order to promote science education, the NRM enhanced the pay of
science teachers by over 300%. We have also stepped-up investment in STEM
(Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics).

In respect to government UPE and USE schools in urban areas, we allowed them
to charge a small fee to cater for utilities (water and electricity). However, this
has been abused by the headteachers charging exorbitant fees, thus, sending
away the children of the poor from these urban schools. We will, therefore,
stop this practice and set fees commensurate with the cost of utilities.

**4.1.3 Higher Education**

When NRM came to power, Uganda had only one university, Makerere University.
To d a y, the country has 78 universities, of which 10 are public. We are in the
process of setting up two more public universities in Busoga and Bunyoro sub-
regions. Before the NRM came to power, only 4,000 students were enrolled
in university. Currently, enrolment in all universities is 220,800. In order to
give opportunity to students from poor families, that fail to get government
sponsorship, the NRM started a student's loan scheme in 2014. A total of 16,436
students have since been supported through this programme. In addition, the
NRM is continuing with its policy of sponsoring 4,000 students per year in
public universities. During the out-going _kisanja,_ we upgraded infrastructure in
various public universities. For example, we reconstructed the Ivory Tower and
some halls of residence at Makerere University.

To improve the qualifications and skills of primary school teachers to meet the
new minimum education requirement of degree level, we have established a
National Institute for Teacher Education (UNITE). The total enrolment in the
institute has reached 1,000 student teachers.

**4.1.4 Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET)**

Our policy on technical education is to have a technical institute in every
constituency. In the last five years, the NRM has made significant investments
in skills development and created a robust skills development eco-system. To
promote TVET, we have constructed 21 TVET institutes in the past five years
bringing the total to 189 in the country. Currently, 130 out of 353 constituencies
have a TVET school and total enrolment is 22,763.

Six (6) of the TVET institutes have been upgraded to centers of excellence
offering internationally recognised certificates. These are: Uganda Technical
College (UTC) Kichwamba, Uganda Petroleum Institute Kigumba (UPIK),
Uganda Technical College Elgon, Bukalasa Agricultural College, Uganda
Te c h n i c a l College Bushenyi, Uganda Technical College Lira. In order to
streamline TVET, we have established a TVET Council to ensure a hands-on,
minds-on and hearts-on practical vocational and technical education.

**a) Presidential Zonal Industrial Hubs**

In order to address the challenge of unemployment among the youth, we
started a skilling programme for youth outside the formal education system.
The programme trains them in various skills such as carpentry, welding, motor
vehicle mechanics, hair dressing and baking free of charge. Formal education
qualifications are not a requirement. The trainees, upon completion of the 6
months period of training are subjected to a Uganda Vocational and Technical
Assessment Board (UVTAB) examination, after which they acquire a level-one
certificate equivalent to an 0' Level (UCE) certificate. So far, 82,790 youth have
been trained, of which 66,631are from Kampala. The total number of presidential
skilling hubs has grown to 28, across the country.

**b) Formalising Artisans**

To formally recognise, promote tradability of skills and encourage fair
compensation of our artisans in garages, saloons, carpentry workshops, etc., we
have started awarding certificates through Uganda Vocational and Technical
Assessment Board. So far, 338,559 artisans have been assessed and awarded
such certificates.

**4.1.5 Special Needs Education**

The NRM believes in equity, fairness, affirmative action and leaving no one
behind. We have provided support to persons with disabilities and special needs.
We have invested in schools to serve children with special needs in different
parts of the country. These are equipped with facilities to train our children with
special needs in carpentry, mechanics, welding and other vocational skills.

```
Digitising Education
```
In order to enhance quality and efficiency in education and fight corruption in
the sector, the NRM has adopted digitisation. The national school register and
school's inspection, are being digitised. All newly constructed seed schools
are now equipped with functional ICT laboratories to support e-learning and
promote digital literacy.

Using a digital system: Teacher Effectiveness and Learner Achievement (TELA),
we are in the process of solving the long-standing challenge of teacher
absenteeism. To implement the system, 14,000 smartphones were distributed to
government-aided schools to "catch" teachers and students who dodge classes.
As a result of utilising this system, the average teacher class attendance has
improved from 27% to 80%. We have also rolled out a system: e-inspection, to
improve school inspection in all the districts, cities and municipalities, across
the country. The system has helped to improve inspection coverage to 86%.

**4.2 Health**

Over the years, the NRM has deepened its commitment to ensure that every
Ugandan enjoys their fundamental and constitutional right to health. Our
strategy on health is two-fold: preventive (health promotion) and curative
(rehabilitative and palliative care).

The NRM inherited a dilapidated health system in 1986. For example,
immunization coverage was 30%; and this was limited to only six (6) killer
diseases of Polio, Diptheria, whooping cough, Tuberculosis, Measles and
Te t a n u s. We have since added eight other immunizable diseases namely:
Hepatitis B (cancer of the Liver), Human Pappiloma Virus (HPV) (cancer of the
cervix), Rota Virus Vaccine (diarrhea), Yellow fever, Measles Rubella vaccine,
Pneumococcal Vaccine (Pneumonia), Haemophilus Influenza Vaccine (Influenza
type B) and Malaria. Our immunization coverage is over 95% and the 5% is on
account of the parents that have not brought their children for immunization.

We have also invested in health infrastructure. Uganda now boasts of 78
hospitals, of which 54 are general hospitals (GH), 16 regional referral hospitals
(RRH), 5 national referral hospitals and 3 specialised hospitals. We have 217
HCIVs at constituency level and 1,553 sub-counties have a health unit of HC III
and above. This is contrasted against only 49 hospitals and 597 dispensaries
that Uganda had in 1986.

```
In the last kisanja, we continued to improve healthcare infrastructure and

hospitals; continued infrastructure development and equipping of the two
specialised centres for cancer and cardiovascular care; infrastructure
development of Lubowa Specialised Hospital, which is now at advanced stages
of completion. We constructed new maternity wards and staff houses in HCIIIs;
distributed 20 digital X-ray machines to General Hospitals; and installed CT
scans in 14 out of 16 Regional Referral Hospitals. We procured one (1) MRI scan
for Mbarara RRH, and ICU equipment for 14 RRHs. A 250 -bed capacity state-
of-the-art cardiac (heart) hospital is under construction. We also constructed
445 HCIIIs, upgraded 34 HCIIIs to HCIVs, and upgraded 7 HCIVs to District

```
Hospitals, namely Kotido, Koboko, Luweero, Kyegegwa, Amuria, Rukunyu, and

```
The salaries of medical workers were also enhanced. The budget for medicines
and supplies to enable delivery of quality health care at the various health units
in the country was also increased.

In order to improve monitoring of clinician outputs, patient management and
prevent theft of medicine, the NRM government is rolling out an in-facility
electronic medical record system which is a digital tool for management of
health facility processes. The system has functions for management of medical
supplies, consultations, treatments, procedures, investigations, admissions and
generation of reports. The system is already deployed in 77 health facilities (4
NRH, 15 RRH, 54 GH and 4 HCIV). It has improved documentation and management
of clinician outputs as it is able to show services rendered by each clinician.
Where it has been deployed, we have registered marked reduction in stockouts
of medicines and other medical supplies.

As a result of the above interventions, the health indicators have greatly im-
proved as follows: Mothers delivering at health facilities have now increased to
over 80% from 37% in 2001. The overall maternal mortality ratio has reduced
to 189 per 100,000 live births from 336 per 100,000 live births in the past 10
years; infant mortality rate has reduced to 28 per 1,000 live births in 2024, from
122 per 1,000 live births in 1986. Malaria incidence reduced to 230 per 1,000
from 302 per 1,000 people over the past five years. Life expectancy at birth has
improved to 68 years, from 45 years in 1986.

**4.3 Water for Human Use**

The NRM continues to invest in the provision of clean water, sanitation and hy-
giene (WASH) as well as protection of our environment. Our target is for every
Ugandan has access to water, sanitation and hygiene. Currently, seven (7) in
every ten (10) households have access to clean water and within a walkable dis-
tance of not more than 500 meters. When we came to power, it was only three
(3) in every ten (10) households which had access to clean water; and they had
to walk at least a kilometer to find it.

In the Last _kisanja,_ we added 297 piped water supply and sanitation systems in
various towns across the country, each serving a population of 3,000 to 5,000
people. We have also constructed several gravity flow schemes and drilled
boreholes across the country. As a result, the number of villages with a clean
water source has increased to 57,313 from 38,809 villages, in 2021. Eight (8)
in ten (10) villages now have a clean water source. In water stressed areas
of Moyo, Kyankwanzi, Nakasongola, Rakai, Buyende and Kasese, solar powered
water systems were constructed.

**Our Promise**

**A. Rural Water and Sanitation**

The NRM Strategy is to provide a clean and safe water source in every village.

**4.4 Environment and Natural Resource Management**

Uganda's prosperity and the well-being of its people are closely linked to
the sustainable management of our abundant natural resources. As a nation
blessed with forests, wetlands, vast water bodies, and diverse ecosystems, our
development trajectory depends on our stewardship of this invaluable heritage.
The NRM has consistently championed the protection and sustainable utilisation
of these resources, recognising their critical role in agriculture, energy, tourism,
social wellbeing and overall national development.

Over the last five years, significant strides have been made in managing our
natural resources. We have increased the country's forest cover to 13% from
9.5% in 2015. A crackdown on illegal encroachment and unsustainable practices
has led to the restoration of crucial buffer zones around major water bodies.
We have implemented policies that promote a holistic approach to natural
resource management. We have also empowered local communities to become
stewards of their water resources, with support for initiatives like sustainable
fishing practices and tree planting along riverbanks to prevent soil erosion.

We have also protected our wetlands. Uganda has a wetland cover of 10-13%
of the land area, and these perform functions that are difficult and costly to
replace if lost. The total length of wetlands in Uganda is 144,319.06 km. In the
last five years, we:
i) Demarcated 3,217.43 km with pillars and live markers;
ii) Restored 1,284.90 km' of wetlands;
iii) Gazetted and published 8,614 wetlands;

```
iv) Cancelled 330 certificates of land titles issued in wetlands, and preparations
for cancelling another 300 are in final stages;
```
v) Increased the area under wetland management from 6,507.34 km' to

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 145

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
```
6,669.16 km2 in 2023 and 2024.
```
vi) Sensitised rice farmers in wetlands to voluntarily stop and instead, lawfully
and sustainably re-purpose them for higher incomes as is being done at
Limoto in Kibuku.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Strengthen regulation and enforcement against degradation of our
environment, including protection of our water bodies;
ii) Invest in urban forestry/greening of cities and other urban areas;
iii) Support value addition for sustainable commercial forestry;

5.1 Democracy
```
Democracy is one of the four core principles of the NRM, the others being
Patriotism, Pan-Africanism and Socio-Economic transformation. Our governance
approach is people-centered, based on grassroot systems that are founded on
justice, regular free and fair elections; and protection of individual human rights
and civil liberties. These hard-won constitutional freedoms are the bedrock of
our democracy.

```
The NRM Government inherited a broken democracy, but through concerted
efforts, we restored the vote to the disenfranchised people of Uganda. We
empowered various marginalized groups like women, youth, people with
disabilities and the elderly to become part of decision-making processes right
from Village Councils to the Districts, Cabinet, and Parliament. These special
interest groups have their respective elective councils from village to the
national level. The workers are also represented in Parliament as a special
interest group.
```
```
In the past (post-independence), political parties were inclined towards tribes
and religions. We have fostered governance that promotes unity of all peoples
in Uganda irrespective of tribe, religion and other forms of sectarianism. That is
why NRM has, and will continue to win elections across the country.
```
```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 149
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
Ugandans should recall that the Uganda Peoples' Congress (UPC) Government
had abolished Cultural leaders following the 1966 debacle. We therefore,
deliberately restored Traditional/Cultural leaders in the areas where they are
cherished and these have been supported to perform their roles.

As a way to ensure that human rights are upheld, we set up the Uganda Human
Rights Commission to protect and promote human rights and freedoms in
Uganda. This Commission has powers of the High Court in adjudicating cases
regarding abuse of human rights. We also passed a law against torture which
provides for sanctions on individuals within the security forces who engage in
any form of torture.

We further introduced electoral reforms to restore democracy, such as;

```
i) Ensuring that candidates are given enough time for their nomination at all
levels;
ii) Names of all candidates appearing on the same ballot paper with their
symbols (including photos);
iii) Ballots being cast in the same box on the election day;
iv) Candidates having agents at polling stations and tally centers;
```
v) Voting secretly but in the open. The votes are counted at the polling station
and results declared in the presence of voters;

vi) Entering results of all candidates for a particular post in the declaration of
results forms;

vii) Signing of declaration forms by the candidates' polling agents. Incase
an agent does not agree with the results, they are allowed to state their
concern on the declaration form;

viii) Independent tallying by candidates using the results in the declaration
forms given to the agents at the polling stations or tally centres. In case of

```
150 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
```
any variation with the results announced by the Electoral Commission, the
candidates can challenge the results in courts of law;
ix) Using biometric voter verification technology to identify the voters
through their biometrics, to stop ballot staffing, multiple voting and voting
in another person's name.
```
These reforms have enabled the NRM to create a firm foundation for a solid
democracy and rule of law in Uganda.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Continue to conduct regular free and fair elections;
ii) Continue to support women, youths, People with Disabilities (PWDs),
workers and the elderly to participate in policy and decision making at all
levels. Affirmative Action shall be promoted in all organs of Government;
iii) Promote use of digital technologies in elections, and ensuring careful
monitoring and oversight to prevent manipulation;
iv) Strengthen the National Electoral Commission's capacity to; undertake
mass civic education and to conduct free and fair elections;
```
v) Support the timely handling and resolution of all electoral disputes; and

vi) Continue to support the Inter Party Organization for Dialogue (IPOD) to
promote inter-party dialogue.

**5.2 Decentralisation**

When we took over power in 1986, we introduced the people's councils to
democratize state power, empower citizens, improve public service delivery, and
promote accountability and responsiveness. Our belief is that when the people
manage themselves through their elected leaders, they are served better.

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 151
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
Through decentralisation, we introduced Local Government councils at District/
City/Municipality and sub-county/town council levels, led by directly elected
chairpersons. The district councilors represent sub-counties in the district and
a third of them are women. At the Sub-County Council, the councilors represent
parishes. In all the District and Sub-County Councils the special interest groups
(youth, persons with disabilities, elderly and workers) are represented.

We also decentralised power to these Local Governments to enable them
oversee implementation of Government programmes in their jurisdictions. The
districts have District Service Commissions which are appointed by the District
Chairperson upon approval by the District Council. These District Service
Commissions have power to appoint and discipline (including dismissal) civil
servants in the district, save for the CAO and RDC who are appointed by Central
Government.

The political leaders at the sub-county and district level have a duty to supervise
the services delivered within their area of jurisdiction as a way of checking the
performance of the civil servants. However, there are tendencies of failure by
the political leaders to duly exercise their powers over the civil servants hence,
leading to poor service delivery and overt corruption.

If these Local Governments exercised their powers in the interest of the people,
some of the challenges of corruption and poor service delivery would be unheard
of or would be minimized. For instance, if the councilors and chairpersons at both
sub-counties and districts were active, theft of medicine and staff absenteeism
would be minimised. Also, some of the land disputes would not arise if the Sub-
County Land Committees and District Land Boards were effectively doing their
work.

Where the services are not being delivered to the required standards, the
District Council should be able to bring to order the concerned civil servants.
Furthermore, where the concerned civil servants need to be reprimanded, the

```
152 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
District Service Commissions (DSC) should be able to discipline them, including
dismissal from service in accordance with the law. However, gaps exist in the
performance of these DSCs, and we have been getting reports that some of
them are involved in selling jobs, denying our young people opportunity to
serve. This is going to be dealt with.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Continue to induct new elected leaders on their roles of monitoring and
supervising the delivery of public services within local governments;
ii) Encourage the people who are asked by members of District service
Commission to pay bribes to report to the anti-corruption agencies;
iii) Work towards filling the critical vacancies at all levels in Local
Governments; and
iv) Continue to hold accountability for a (barazas) between the Citizens,
Elected leaders and the Local Government technical team at all levels.
```
**5.3 Fighting Corruption**

Corruption remains one of the major challenges to our democracy and overall
service delivery. While we have made progress in fighting corruption, it remains
a significant challenge that we are determined to defeat.

The NRM has been supporting the fight against corruption through; the
Inspectorate of Government (IGG) to oversee public officer accountability; Office
of the Auditor General (OAG) to independently audit government accounts;
and Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to investigate and prosecute
corruption cases, the CID, Parliament Accountability Committees and other anti-
corruption agencies.

```
We have digitalized a number of government services such as; the online
```
```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 153

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
application for passports, driving permits, Electronic Fiscal Receipting and
Invoicing Solution (EFRIS) for revenue collection, Online Business Registration
System (OBRS) by the URSB, Electronic Government Procurement (e-GP) and
the Electronic Court Cases Management Information Systems (ECCMIS) for
filing and disposal of cases in the judicial system. These have helped to reduce
corruption in service delivery.

We have validated civil servants by taking their biometrics and this process
exposed a number of ghost workers who were on the civil service pay roll. These
were subsequently removed and people responsible are being prosecuted.

**Our Promise.**

```
NRM will:
i) Strengthen the corruption investigative institutions; Inspectorate of
Government (IGG), Office of the Auditor General (OAG); Directorate of
Public Prosecutions (DPP), CID, Parliament Accountability Committees and
other anti-corruption agencies in execution of their mandates;
ii) Sensitize the masses to report corruption cases in accordance with the
Whistle Blowers Act (2011);
iii) Hold Chief Administrative Officers (CAOs), RDCs and DISOs accountable for
their inaction in the fight against corruption;
iv) Sensitize elected local leaders (including NRM party leaders) on their
mandate in monitoring service delivery and where they find faults, they
take action;
```
v) Continue to digitalize the various government service delivery systems
to eliminate corruption. For instance, we will introduce body cameras for
the police. We will ensure that all applications for Government services
(building permits, investment permits, mining permits, etc.) are made online
and responses provided to the applicants in a defined period;

```
154 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
vi) Continue to build the capacity of the Anti-Corruption division of the High
court to efficiently adjudicate corruption cases; and

vii) Progressively enhance salaries for teachers, medical officers, and other
public servants to eliminate corruption of need which is fueled by the
struggle to meet basic needs.

**5.4 Security of Life and Property**

```
One of NRM's core strengths is securing the lives and property of Ugandans.
Before capturing power in 1986, insecurity was widespread throughout Uganda.
Ugandans lived in constant fear; extra-judicial killings and looting were so rife;
people were often hiding whenever they encountered soldiers or policemen.
NRM reversed this reality by creating a professional army, demystifying the
gun, democratizing the country, and fostering positive interactions between
security forces and citizens.
```
We have maintained an unwavering focus on strengthening Uganda's national
security foundations. Through capacity building of the security organs, we have
reinforced state guarantees of security for persons and property. This correlates
with increased respect for human rights and freedoms, and the emergence of a
vibrant civil society.

The capacity of security forces in terms of numbers, quality, and equipment has
improved. For the case of the Uganda Police Force (UPF), the police numbers
have grown from 3,000 in 1986 to 46,000 officers in 2025. Quality has also
improved through emphasis on recruiting better-educated personnel including
university graduates.

Security threats keep on changing as the society grows and the focus now is
to address recent rural and urban criminality as well as Cyber Crime. The NRM
Government has installed CCTV cameras throughout cities and along highways
which have proven effective in apprehending criminals.

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 155
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
Moving forward, NRM will continue creating pro-people security forces, well
equipped and trained in civilian interaction. We will continue equipping the Police
Force in forensic investigation capabilities to enhance their effectiveness in
fighting crime. Improving the welfare of the UPDF, Police and Prisons personnel
remains a priority.

**5.4.1 Uganda Peoples Defense Forces (UPDF)**

NRM government promised and assured Ugandans that we would continue
building and strengthening the UPDF. This has been done. The national borders
are secure. The UPDF continues to maintain a proactive posture, with zonal and
operational deployments to deal with emerging threats.

Our security forces have undertaken various counter terrorism operations which
have yielded positive results. Within the previous term, UPDF built sufficient
Counter-terrorism capability in terms of personnel and equipment.

In regard to disarmament and anti-stock theft operations in Karamoja, the UPDF
launched operation "Usalama Kwa Wote" in July 2021.This was augmented
with operation "DHUMISHA AMANI" in April 2023 which helped to reduce
Karamojong incursions in Acholi, Teso and tango Sub-regions. The operations
also recovered 49,025 animals which were handed over to the rightful owners.
We also neutralized the ADF who operated from Eastern DRC.

Government has significantly eliminated various criminal gangs such as _Kifeesi,_
B-10 and _Bukolwacrew_ within Kampala Capital City. This has curtailed subversive
activities, creating a conducive environment to support of the government's
socio-economic transformation agenda.

Cyber insecurity has been an emerging threat due to advancement in technology.
The army established a cyber-security unit to detect, prevent and curtail acts
of cyber-crime and built capacity to handle cyber threats. In April 2023, the
Ugandan Government established the National Forensic science university in

```

```

```

```
Jinja which offers courses in cyber security Studies, Forensic investigations, and
information science.

In addition, the UPDF Fisheries Protection Unit continues to combat illegal
fishing and smuggling of fish in the country. Over 90,900 tons of immature
fish and assorted illegal fishing gear worth billions had been impounded and

destroyed by June 2025. As a result of their work, export of fish resumed.

Uganda, through the spirit of Pan-Africanism, has participated in various
Regional Security Obligations. In 2021, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
and Uganda, agreed on joint military operations against ADF in Eastern DRC

territories (under Operation Shujaa). The UPDF also maintains deployments
under the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS). Subsequently,
democratic processes have been undertaken to rebuild Somalia and piracy
on the Indian Ocean was controlled. Further, in the Pan-African spirit, Uganda
provides military training support to Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Guinea Bissau
through bilateral arrangements.

The NRM Government continued the professionalization and modernization
of the defense and security forces through recruitment, training, acquisition
of equipment and enhancement of personnel welfare. We acquired, equipped,
maintained and refurbished military equipment to facilitate quick response to
the prevailing and emerging security threats.

In 2022, the NRM Government established the National Defense College-Uganda
(NDC-U) dedicated to providing advanced military education and strategic
training to high-ranking military and civilian officials in Uganda. Furthermore,
salary enhancement for UPDF, UPF and Prison Services personnel has been
implemented through a phased approach.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will;
i) Continue to professionalize the UPDF by continuing to train its personnel
and equip it with modern weapons, equipment and technology;
ii) Enhance protection of vital assets and security installations which are
crucial to national development;
iii) Safeguard Uganda's Digital Sovereignty;
iv) Strengthen efforts to counteract radicalism and ensure stability of the
country;
```
**v) Strengthen capacity of UPDF to participate in production and value

vi) Continue to enhance the welfare of the UPDF personnel;

vii) Establish and operationalise a National Service program to build patriotism;
and

viii) Enhance coordination of national security and intelligence infrastructure
to maintain peace and stability across the country.

**5.4.2 The Uganda Police Force (UPF)**

Given Uganda's population of 45.9 million people and the recommended UN
policing ratio of 1:500, UPF should have a force with a strength of 91,306
personnel. The current personnel strength is 50,826 leaving a gap of 40,480.
Uganda Police continues to recruit and train personnel to fill this gap.

In an effort to professionalize the security forces, 12,325 Police Officers and
2,649 prisons officers have respectively undergone Command and Leadership,
Specialised courses, refresher and initial training courses.

We are progressively creating a pro- people force that is well trained to handle
civilians, UPF kick-started operationalization of the sub county policing model
with Greater Masaka Police Region. So far, 98 sub county police stations are
implementing the policing model in this Region.

Government has equipped the police in forensic investigations to improve
fighting against crime, the capacity of the police has been enhanced to enable it
effectively perform its mandate. The canine department for example has been
expanded to increase capacity for suspects apprehension.

Government through the Directorate of Government Analytical Laboratories
(DGAL) is undertaking construction of the DNA databank. This will support
Intelligence and Crime Investigations which ultimately strengthen the National
Security and criminal identification. Additionally, will also eliminate massive
arrests of suspects before evidence is obtained.

The Flying Squad has been rebuilt and reorganized. The 999 Field units have been
deployed in all the 18 divisions of KMP with the attendant re-activation of the
999/112 Emergency Dispatch System. This "999"/ERU Police Patrol system has
also been decentralised to 07 policing regions- Mbale, Gulu, Masaka, Mbarara,
Arua, Hoima, Jinja, Lira and Soroti. The Central National Emergency call center
handles KMP and the regions not yet decentralised. In addition, communication
is being improved by acquisition of more radios and re- activation of the Police
signals department.

Counter phones were deployed at every Police Station to allow for quick
communication between the station and the public especially during response
to distress or emergencies.

To enhance Police protection, 17 new Police Stations were established in other
areas like Kwania, Kapelebyong, Rukungiri, Bululu, Busia, Nakasongola, Katwe-
Kabatooro, West Nile Regional Headquarters, Kiira Regional Headquarters,
Savannah Regional Headquarters in Luweero the others are in the Karamoja
region (Namalu, Alakas, Nakiloro, Apeitolim, Lokori, Nakaperimoru and Morulem).
The regulatory framework for Private Security Organizations (PSOs) is
undergoing comprehensive review to improve oversight and control, this
includes training standardization, recruitment of personnel and acquisition
of security equipment. In order to strengthen supervision and compliance of
PSOs, management has suspended operations of 26 PSOs who were in default
of expected standards (statutory obligation).

Government enhanced the capability of the Uganda Police Force through
acquisition of assorted security equipment to facilitate effective response to
emergencies and management of crime. These include light armoured personnel
carriers for public order management, pickup vehicles and troop and logistics
carriers.

```
Regarding improvement of the welfare of both the police and the UPDF,
```
```

```
Government constructed and commissioned 528 Police staff houses across
the country and also installed 5,410 double occupancy uniports to temporarily
mitigate accommodation challenges thus the number of entitled police
officers housed has increased to 26%. With the completion of the 364 ongoing
construction works in FY2023/24 at Jinja, Entebbe and Naguru, the number of
entitled officers housed is expected to improve.

With the completion of the Criminal Intelligence Headquarters in Kololo, district
police stations in Kwania & Kapelebyong, the number of own office space has
increased from 84 to 87 thus saving on rent. A total of 124 Housing units were
renovated in Soroti, Entebbe and Mbale and asbestos roofs that was declared a
health hazard were replaced with iron sheets.
Government is working on a housing project under the Private, Public Partnership
(PPP) arrangement to construct 69,000 housing units across the country for
Police.

Over 3,746 (586 female) Police officers had benefitted from low priced
construction items from Duty Free Shop.

**Our promise**

The NRM is committed to professionalize and modernize the Police Force to
enable it fight crime and impunity. We will:

```
i) Implement the sub-county policing model to ensure that the optimal
execution of a unified rural policing strategy;
ii) Recruit more personnel to achieve a ratio of 1:500;
iii) Increase efforts to undertake specialised training of the Police Force to
build its capacity in police management and in areas like; crowd control,
human rights, cyber crime, etc;
iv) Provide the Police Force with modern equipment, i.e. body cameras,
protective gear, etc;

centers and along highways; and

viii) Continue with implementation of the Intelligent Transportation Monitoring
System (ITMS) to monitor vehicles and respond to traffic security threats.

**5.5 Promoting Justice and Rule of Law**

In 1986, we inherited a lawless country, devoid of constitutionalism and rule of
law, characterised by extra judicial killings and anarchy. In order to correct this
problem, we set up a constitutional commission which gathered the views of the
population on how they wanted to be governed. Thereafter, we asked Ugandans
to elect their representatives to debate and promulgate the constitution in 1995.
Where we have amended the constitution, we have done it through the people's
representatives in parliament.

As provided for in the constitution, we built an independent Judiciary which
supports stability, justice, rule of law, sustainable development, and prosperity
for all.

In order to improve the terms of service of the judicial officers, we enacted
the Administration of Judiciary Act, 2020 which among others provides for;
the efficient and effective administration of the Judiciary; strengthening the
independence of the Judiciary; and retirement benefits of judicial officers and
related matters.

**Progress**

The NRM has improved access to justice by bringing the courts closer to the

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 163
```

```

```
people, ensuring that we have more judicial officers to attend to and dispose
off cases as well as fighting corruption in the administration of justice. In the
previous term the following were achieved;
i) Increased the number of High Court judges from 83 to 151 and Justices of
the Court of Appeal from 15 to 35;

enjoyment of the fundamental freedoms.
```
**5.6 Labour and Employment**

Since 1986, the NRM has stood firm in protecting the dignity of Ugandan workers
and ensuring that their labour remains critical for national transformation. Our
focus has been to create an environment that enables the private sector to
create jobs. As earlier stated under the economy section, the task has been to
avail affordable patient capital, incentives (provision of free land in industrial
parks) and as a result, we now have 50,000 factories providing employment.
Other areas like agriculture, through the support of OWC have been able to
create jobs. The Parish Development Model is also broadening the spectrum of
jobs.

```
On the political side, we have recognized workers as a special interest group
and these have representation at various levels of decision-making including
```
```
166 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
Parliament. This was deliberately done to ensure that the voices of the workers
are heard. Furthermore, we have expanded access to education, which has
resulted into a more supply of labour especially from the youth. We are now
emphasising on vocational education so as to produce the necessary critical
skills required in the job market.

As the country advances towards high middle-income status, our workers will
continue to play a central role in the development of our country.

NRM strengthened labour governance policies that improved protection
for workers, clarified employer obligations, and promoted decent work. The
establishment of the Industrial Court, Medical Arbitration Board, Labour
Advisory Boards have improved dispute resolution and strengthened social
dialogue among employers, workers, and government. The government has
also ratified key ILO conventions which have helped to align national labour
standards with international best practices. NRM will further work to reduce
unemployment and improve working conditions.

```
Our Promise:
```
```
NRM will;
i) Continue to attract investments which will lead to creation of jobs. The
more investments we attract, the better the terms for workers arising
from the increased demand for jobs;
ii) Continue to support our wealth creation initiatives as drivers of new
employment opportunities;
iii) Continue to train our people in the relevant skills that align with the job
market;
```
```
iv) Strengthen compliance with labour laws, policies, guidelines, standards
and rights to among other things improve Occupational Safety and Health
(OSH) management across the country;
```
```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 167
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
v) Special attention will be given to safeguarding fair wages, timely payment
of salaries, and secure employment contracts to shield workers from
casualization and exploitation;

vi) Ensure that industrial parks have designated areas for development of
convenient workers' housing; and

vii) Develop a National Management Information System (MIS)/Database on
Labour Force and Enterprise to provide reliable data to guide policy-making,

**5.7 Affirmative Development Initiatives**

The NRM Government has over the years implemented various affirmative
development programmes in areas which were affected by war. Some of these
programmes included;
(i) Northern Uganda Rehabilitation Programme (NURP)
(ii) Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF I, II and III)
(iii) Peace Recovery and development Plan (PRDP I, II, and III)
(iv) Cattle restocking
(v) Cattle compensation

```
(vi) Luwero-Rwenzori Development programme
```
Cumulatively, the NRM Government has spent over Shs. 4 trillion on these
programmes. We will continue to implement the affirmative programmes to
further ameliorate the effect of war and conflict caused in these areas.

**a) Cattle compensation**

In regard to implementation of the livestock compensation exercise of war debt
claimants and/beneficiaries in Acholi, tango and Teso sub-regions. The NRM
Government has so far paid Shs 159.50 bn to 28,281 Claimants and/Beneficiaries
in the Sub-Regions of Acholi, tango and Teso Sub-Region. Specifically; 4,836
claimants from Acholi Sub-Region were paid a total of Shs 43,666,954,842;
in tango Sub-Region 12,389 Claimants/beneficiaries were paid a total of Shs
48,736,020,500 in Teso Sub-Region 11,056 claimants/beneficiaries were paid a
total of Shs 65,912,898,246.

**b) NUSAF**

NUSAF has been one of the largest safety-net programs targeting households
in the poorest and most vulnerable districts in Northern and Eastern Uganda.
Under NUSAF, 67 districts were covered and benefited nearly 600,000
households (approx. 3 million persons). All three phases of NUSAF have focused
on expanding safety nets, promoting sustainable livelihoods and building
institutional capacity at the local level.
Implementation of this programme has made positive impact on the poor and
vulnerable households. However, not-withstanding the achievements of the
various interventions, significant socio-economic challenges still remain in the
area. Hence the need to implement NUSAF IV.
NUSAF IV is designed to continue improving the livelihoods of the communities
and will cover 83 districts, 7 cities in 6,631 parishes of Northern, Eastern
Uganda and Bunyoro. NUSAF will support an estimated total 3,375,000 rural
smallholders in the agricultural value chain by enhancing production, agro
processing and marketing services thereby contributing to increased income
earnings, improved savings and help the extremely poor and vulnerable to get
out of poverty.

```
**5.8 Land Governance**

The size of Uganda is 241,038 sq. km of which 197,100 sq. km is covered by land.
Over the years, Ugandans have enjoyed this resource as a source of livelihood.
Before colonialism, land was available for communal use: held for grazing
purposes and small-scale subsistence agriculture. Land tenure and management
was perpetually customary where clan leaders held land in trust on behalf of
the clan members, a practice that has remained upheld to present day in some
parts of Uganda. These inherent traditions of land ownership and use could
only be distorted by a force foreign to them through colonialism leading to a
number of historical errors.

The 1900 Buganda Agreement introduced a number of changes in land
ownership. Land ownership became more individualized. For instance, before
this agreement, the Kabaka of Buganda owned land as a trustee of the dwellers
of the land. However, the Agreement divided land ownership in Buganda into
crown land (under the control of the colonial government) and mailo land
(owned by the Kabaka, the chiefs and other prominent leaders at the time).
In the rest of present-day Uganda, the situation was not different. In Acholi,

```
170 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
Lango, Karamoja, and some parts of Bukedi up to now, land is owned by the clans
on behalf of its members. In short, the colonial period changed the traditional
communal use of land and exposed it to market forces of supply and demand.
The distribution of interests in land to some individuals at the expense of others
led to a number of social inequalities. For example, in the case of Buganda, mailo
titles were issued on land which was already occupied hence, the occupants
became tenants of the landlord and were required by law to pay a tax (obusuulu
and _envujjo)_ to the new mailo land owner.

This created two classes of people on the land; the mailo owner and the _kibanja_
holder (tenant). The tenancy rights of _bibanja_ owners were formalised in 1928,
when the colonial Government sensing that the continued increase of the
land tax by the landlord was causing unrest, passed the Busuulu and Envujjo
Law (1928). The law created new relations between landlords and tenants by
reducing the arbitrariness in tax levy (busuulu) and insecurity in those relations.
It denied the landlords the power to charge an economic rent and kept it nominal
to safeguard tenants from exploitation and eviction.

This dual ownership of land in Buganda, with a controlled busuulu, stayed on
until 1975 when The Land Reform Decree of 1975, enacted by Idi Amin's regime
significantly altered land ownership in Uganda by nationalising all land and
converting freehold titles to leases. The Land Decree declared all land in Uganda
public land and title to it was vested in the Uganda Land Commission (ULC).

As a consequence of this change, mailo landowners lost their land without
compensation. All land, including mailo, was converted into leaseholds. This in
effect deprived the people of their right to full ownership of land.

The NRM, through its principles of democracy and socio-economic
transformation, championed good land governance by introducing reforms
in land tenure and management systems. These included the enactment
of the 1995 Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, and the 1998 Land Act
as amended. In the 1995 Constitution, ownership of land was returned to

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 171
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
the citizens of Uganda thus restoring mailo land alongside the other tenure
systems: Customary, Freehold, and Leasehold. In effect, NRM balanced the
interests of the landlords and the tenants by returning land to the landlords
but also recognized the legal interests of the _bibanja_ owners. We recognized
six categories of _bibanja_ owners:

a. The one that was given _kibanja_ by the landlord or his agent;

```
b. The one who was on that kibanja in 1983 or before — whom we termed the
bonafide occupant;
```
c. The one that was first to settle on former public land, subject to a 12 -year
occupation rule (having been on that land before October 1983);

d. The one who bought from one of (`a'2I3' and 'c') above;

e. The one who inherited from one of (b) and (c) above;

f. Those that were settled by the Government like the ones settled in Kisiita
(Kakumiro district) and Kanyaryeru (Kiruhura district).

All these six categories are lawful tenants by occupancy and are entitled to be
issued with certificates of occupancy and it is reflected on the Mailo owner's
title as an encumbrance. Therefore, nobody should evict them. We also agreed
that the _bibanja_ owners pay a nominal/reasonable rent, not the market rate.
We further agreed to capitalize the Land Fund annually to compensate the
landlords on a "willing buyer/willing seller" basis, and give the land back to
the sitting tenants upon verification. Through this fund, we have compensated
several absentee landlords in Bunyoro, Ankole, Tooro and Buganda. The above
legal position notwithstanding, the common land problems that have persisted
include:

a. Eviction of lawful tenants on mailo land in disregard of the Constitution
and the 1998 Land Act as amended;
b. In settling with tenants, some landlords issue titles for less acreage
to tenants. For instance, if a _kibanja_ owner has settled on 10 acres, the

```
172 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
```
landlord takes six acres and gives a title for only four acres to the kibanja
owner. This is an injustice to the bibanja owners;
c. District Land Boards allocating unregistered customary land that is already
occupied by customary owners who are recognized by the Constitution;
d. Untitled land, creating barriers for the owners to use as collateral in
financial institutions or to lease out to investors;
e. Multiple titling of land by unscrupulous land dealers "bafere" in connivance
with corrupt officers in the land management institutions;
```
f. Lack of notification to the lessee about renewal of the lease upon expiry
and land is allocated to another person.

```
g. Corruption in the court system involving judicial officers entertaining cases
where people on the land are not served notice and they lose the case in
absentia;
h. Traditional cultural practices that deny vulnerable groups like women,
persons with disabilities, children, youth among others from inheriting land;
i. Land fragmentation in respect to rural agricultural land which has affected
the full economic use of land;
```
```
In order to address the land problems above, a number of interventions were
undertaken;

(ii) In order to secure the rights of customary land owners, Government has
developed two systems;
a) the Systematic Land Adjudication and Certification (SLAAC) to issue
freehold titles to sitting customary owners under the freehold tenure
system. This involves mobilization, sensitization, surveying and issuance
of land titles to the owners at a subsidised fee of Shs. 85,000 irrespective
of the size of land. This is issued by the Registrar of Titles. Under this
programme, we have processed and issued 24,000 titles to beneficiaries in
Kiruhura, Ibanda, Rwampara, Kaabong and 0yam and the city of Mbarara;

```
For the faith-based institutions, Government pledged to assist them
to register their land upon submission of applications. So far, Church
of Uganda has submitted 3,107 applications from its 39 dioceses for
processing and issuance of freehold land titles;
b) Issuance of Certificates of Customary Ownership (CCOs) under the
customary tenure system. This involves mobilization, sensitization,
surveying and issuance of certificates of ownership at a subsidised
fee of Shs. 10,000 irrespective of the size of land. Under a self-
financing model, a minimal operational fee between Shs. 70,000 to
Shs. 100,000 is set by the District Local Governments to facilitate and
sustain customary land registration. The CCO is issued by a Recorder
at sub-county/ town council and in the case of a city, it is at the division
level. So far 103,000 certificates have been issued in the districts of;
Kasese, Nwoya, Pader, Butaleja, Adjumani, Kisoro, Kabale, Mbale and
Mbale City, Agago, Apac, Maracha, Soroti, Katakwi, Kalaki, Dokolo,
Amolatar, Terego, Gulu, Koboko, Moroto, Amudat, Kaabong, Nabilatuk,
Nakapiripirit, and Namutumba;
The issuance of certificates is aimed at improving the land tenure
security (mitigate risks of land evictions, grabbing, landlessness and
economic well-being);
Government supported the registration and incorporation of 915
clans and communities in the Greater North to become legal entities
called Communal Land Associations (CLAs). For example, 15,000 acres
of communal lands owned by the Omiya Pacwa, Lapono and Paimol
clans were secured and consolidated for leasing to investors under
the Parish to Market (P2M) project in the sub region;
```
(iii) In order to protect the rights of tenants on registered land under the mailo
tenure system, Government introduced the Land Inventory Protocol (LIP)
as social evidence of occupancy and the Certificates of Occupancy (CODs)
as legal evidence of possession. Under these processes, Government
demarcates the _kibanja_ of the tenants and if you have the evidence of
paying busuulu, you get the COO and if not, you get the LIP.
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 175

NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
```
The reason most people do not have Certificates of Occupancy (CODs) is
because the current living landlords do not have Letters of Administration
to update the ownership of the mailo land title. The Certificates of
Occupancy (CODs) and Land Inventory Protocols (LIPs) are registered as
encumbrances on the Registered Proprietor's mailo title, hence the kibanja
holder should never be evicted from the land;
So far 104,340 Land Inventory Protocols (LIPs) and 558 Certificates of
Occupancy (CODs) have been processed and issued acrossthe country. These
have returned peace, harmony and productivity to the tenants without any
further threat of eviction. However, in some places like Butambala District,
2,043 parcels of land have been mapped out but politicians de-campaigned
the exercise and as a result, the affected people have not received their
certificates; and
(iv) We have also reduced the average time in processing a land title from 15 to
10 days.

Certificates of Customary Ownership (CCOs);
iii) Increase the Land Fund to; complete payment for 71,094.025 acres of land

**6 REGIONAL INTEGRATION AND**

**POLITICAL FEDERATION**

pan-Africanism is one of the core principles of the NRM. This is a key pillar
guiding our cooperation framework with fellow Africans. We recognise the
need for our unity as a basis of rewriting the mistakes that the colonialists
made in dividing us. The political balkanisation of Africa created small states,
many of which have small populations. Uganda, with 46 million people, is one of
the bigger states. The solution to this problem is regional integration.

The whole of Africa has got a very high population of 1.4 billion people, but, this
population is broken up into small units. Small populations mean small markets.
The problem is compounded by low purchasing power because of low incomes.
There are also problems in the regional market, such as lack of roads and lack of
communication to enable us to fully exploit the regional market. That is why, for
instance, Uganda undertook with DRC, to construct the Mpondwe-Beni highway,
to ease connectivity between the two countries. If we mobilise the whole of Africa
to remove all trade barriers, we shall no longer worry about being shut out of
markets in Europe, the USA, etc.

We cannot guarantee our prosperity unless we give our producers of goods
and services a big market through market integration in the whole of Africa.
The NRM, right from the time of our Chairman's student activities in 1963 ,
realised that internal markets of many of the individual countries are never big
enough to enable the prosperity of the citizens of countries. It was that search
for the integration of markets that caused the unifications of Germany in 1871
and Italy in 1860. China and India, each with an internal market of 1.3 billion
people, could not realize rapid growth of their economies until they opened their
economies to enable trade and the inflow of investments from the whole world.

```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
That is why we supported the Abuja Treaty of 1991 and the CFTA of 2017. These
were all to create the Free Continental market of Africa, so as to, precisely, solve
the problems Uganda is facing right now — too much sugar, too much maize,
too much bananas, too much cassava, too much milk etc. It is not too much of
anything. It is only too much of disorganisation. With a well-functioning African
free market, this issue will be addressed. However, market integration alone,
even if it is consummated, cannot solve the problem of strategic inferiority in
defense terms against global threats unless we also carry out political integration
(the Federation of East Africa, etc.); the two — economic and political integration
— will help us to preserve our African identity and heritage. More importantly,
East Africa can negotiate more credibly with the other international players —
the USA, China, India, Russia, etc.

Therefore, ideologically speaking, our enemies are the ones who push for
parochialism and sectarianism (tribalism and religious sectarianism) because
they do not understand the value of economic integration for prosperity and
political integration for strategic security against all and every threat.

The NRM, therefore, worked with Kenya and Tanzania to revive the EAC and
expand it to include Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan. We are now exporting
to the region goods and services to the tune of USD 2.84 billion in FY 2024/25,
yet this is just the start. Much more is possible and much more will be achieved.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Support implementation of activities leading to EAC Political Federation
including the promulgation of the EAC Constitution;
ii) Work within the EAC framework to establish a single EAC currency;
iii) Work with other EAC member countries to eliminate all non-tariff barriers
within the EAC;
iv) Promote the use of Kiswahili language across the country; and
```
v) Take advantage of the provisions in AfCFTA agreement to increase trade
with other African countries.

**/ CONCLUSION**

```
n all the pro-people struggles that the NRM has led, we have always been
careful to employ the appropriate strategy and tactics, guided by our four
principles of Patriotism, Pan-Africanism, Socio-Economic Transformation and
Democracy.
```
Five years ago, we promised you five key deliverables: recovering the economy
from COVID 19 and other shocks, and creating jobs and wealth for all Ugandans;
continuing to offer Ugandans free education, healthcare and clean water;
ensuring justice and equity by maintaining law and order; protecting life and
property of all our people; and deepening economic integration to secure
markets for our wealth creators. In total, we made 809 commitments/promises
to Ugandans.

Dear Ugandans, NRM is a reliable and accountable political organisation. Not
even COVID 19, Ebola, international and regional conflicts, inflation in the global
economy (i.e. high commodity prices, for items like soap, fuel, cooking oil, etc.),
and high interest rates that plagued the world during the last _kisanja_ could
stop us from delivering on our promises. We have delivered 698 out of the
809 commitments/promises we made. This translates to 86.3%, and this, by all
standards is a grade for A-Students.

In this manifesto we are committing to protect the gains of the people
of Uganda that the NRM was, right from the beginning, ready to die for.
We are promising to continue growing the economy and creating wealth

```

for all Ugandans. We will continue championing mass line programmes
that ensure the social uplift of all segments of society and not just
a few elites. We also commit to continue investing in free education,
healthcare and water for our people; and securing their lives and property
while guaranteeing their democracy. With these, Uganda will make a
qualitative leap into a high middle-income economy of USD 500 billion.

Therefore, People of Uganda, vote for H.E. Y.K. Museveni for President and
other NRM flag-bearers at all levels.

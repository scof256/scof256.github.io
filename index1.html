14. To m a t o Sauce Community drainage

In the cities, to deal with traffic congestion arising out of the gridlock generated
by roundabouts and junctions, we have installed traffic signal-controls. For
example, we have installed 66 traffic signal-controls in Kampala that have a
new Traffic Control Centre with capacity to coordinate up to 256 junctions.

**d. District, Urban and Community Access Roads (DUCAR)**

**NRM** prioritised rehabilitation and maintenance of our feeder roads commonly
known as DUCAR. These represent 87% of the total road network in Uganda. In
2016, we bought road construction equipment from Japan and distributed a full
set to each district, except the newly created cities. The equipment included;
graders, wheel loaders, excavators, bulldozers, wheeled backhoe loaders,
rollers, tractors, water bowsers, self-loading trucks, mobile workshops and
bitumen distributors.

We have also allocated funds for road maintenance in each and every district.
In the past five years alone, Shs 991 billion was allocated to districts to grade,
pour murram and compact our district and community roads. Starting 2023,
we increased the budget for road maintenance in Local Governments by Shs
1 billion per district/city/municipality, per year bringing the total to Shs 176
billion. It is surprising, that the state of these roads has instead deteriorated in a
number of districts. Where has this money gone? As we can all see, the problem
now is corruption in Local Governments which we are going to deal with.

**Our promise**

```
NRM will:
```
```
i) Prioritise maintenance of our tarmac and murram roads;
ii) Complete construction of roads, expressways, bridges and drainage as
indicated in tables 3, and 10.
iii) Complete rehabilitation of roads as indicated in table 4 above;
```
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
```
iv) Construct new roads as indicated in tables 5 and 6;
```
**v)** Undertake designs of new roads indicated in **table** 7 above;

vi) Complete construction of the bridges shown in **table** 9 above;

vii) Buy new road construction equipment for the new cities, municipalities
and large districts that require a second set;

viii) Acquire in-house maintenance equipment for routine maintenance of our
road construction equipment;
ix) Build more roads in local governments hosting refugees (Adjumani,
Arua,Isingiro, Kamwenge, Kiryandongo, Koboko, Kyegegwa, Lamwo, Madi-
Okollo, Moyo, Obongi, Terego, and Yumbe); and

x) Expand street lighting by installing more lights and traffic-control signals
in Kampala, regional cities and municipalities.

**3.1.1 Railway Transport**

Railway transport is an integral part of economic development. It lowers
transport costs, freight movement, fosters regional development, attracts
investment, creates jobs and reduces environmental pollution. The NRM
strategy is to build an efficient rail transport system by refurbishing the existing
Meter Gauge Railway (MGR) and constructing a new Standard Gauge Railway
(SGR). This will transform Uganda from being a landlocked to a land-linked
country. The railway is going to help us to cut the cost of transporting cargo by
half, thereby reducing the cost of doing business. It will also remove the cargo
from our roads hence increasing their lifespan, and reducing congestion and
accidents. This will make transport in Uganda more competitive and safer.

In the past Kisanja, we have progressed in rehabilitating the Metre Gauge Railway
from Malaba to Kampala, and from Tororo to Gulu. We have purchased four
mainline locomotives and refurbished wagons to facilitate cargo transportation.
We have revived passenger commuter train from Kampala to Mukono, and plans
are underway to extend it to Jinja.

Construction of the SGR to connect Malaba to Kampala (272km) has started.
The SGR is a very strategic investment for our country. It will not only cut cargo
transport cost by half to USD 60 from the current USD 120 per ton, it will also
help us to reduce transit time from Mombasa to Kampala from 7 days to 1 day.

Area;

vi) Construct a 60 km railway spur from the Majanji Port to Tororo.

**3.1.2 Water Transport**

```
Water transport is the cheapest and oldest mode of transport, yet underutilised.
Now that our revenues have improved, and we have addressed security and
other critical challenges, investment in water transport will be one of our
priorities. We have progressed in modernising Port Bell and Jinja pier, improved
navigation safety and security on water, repaired our ferries and acquired new
ones, and progressed with the construction of the Bukasa Port.

**3.1.3 Air Transport**

NRM recognises the importance of air transport particularly for a landlocked
country like Uganda. That is why we revived the national airline which our new
liberalists had mistakenly appraised on commercial terms and recommended
its closure. Since the revival of Uganda Airlines 5 years ago by our visionary
Chairman, Uganda's connectivity has improved within the continent, the
Middle East, Asia and the United Kingdom. The airline is now flying directly
to 17 destinations, which has contributed to reduced travel time for our
exporters, tourists, and other wealth creators, more so at affordable cost.

The competition brought about by our airline has forced other regional
airlines to reduce the cost of air tickets. For example, a return airticket to
Nairobi has stabilised at about USD 400, compared to USD 800 in 2019.The
national airline is now the largest operator and has 24% market share of
all air travel out of Entebbe Airport, up from 4% in 2019. Its revenue has
increased to Shs 411 billion in FY 2023/24 from Shs 28 billion in FY 2019/20.
With increased capitalisation and acquisition of additional aircrafts, the
airline will increase efficiency and enable travellers to and from Uganda to
enjoy direct and cheaper travel to more destinations.

On infrastructure development, we have invested in a number of strategic
areas including; building new airports, upgrading and expansion of existing
airports, and expanding air cargo transport.

We have constructed 2 new international airports in Hoima and Kidepo in
Karamoja with our friends from Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. We are also
developing aerodromes in Arua, Gulu, Pakuba, Jinja, Kisoro and Kasese to
promote internal travel, trade and tourism.

**3.2 Energy for Sustainable Growth**

Investment in energy is one of the fastest ways to transform a society and
reduce poverty. If you want to develop a village, connect it to electricity. In
1986, Uganda was generating only 60 megawatts (MW) of electricity out of
the installed capacity of 150 megawatts. Only a few towns had electricity and
it was extremely unreliable. We embarked on a mission to generate, transmit
and distribute electricity to all parts of Uganda.

We started by refurbishing the old dam in Jinja and then embarked on building
new dams to generate more electricity. We have since built Kiira dam,
supported private sector to build Bujagali dam, and recently, we invested
heavily in Karuma and Isimba dams. Today we are generating 2,052 Megawatts
of electricity which have enabled us to connect our growth centers, cities,
towns and villages to electricity. All districts, cities and municipalities are
now connected to the national grid, except Buvuma and Obongi. When we
came to power, only half the districts were connected to the electricity. For
the first time in our history, West Nile is also connected to the national grid.
Apart from the large dams, the NRM has worked with the private sector to
build small power plants to enhance access to electricity. Some of the new
power plants that we have commissioned include: Kigwabya Hydropower
Plant (4.2 MW) in Kagadi district; Xsabo Nkonge Solar Plant (20 MW) in Gomba
district; Pro Industries Co-generation Plant (4.3 MW) in Gulu district; and Off-
grid solar systems: 400 kWp on Bussi Island in Wakiso district among others.

In the outgoing _kisanja,_ our emphasis has been on building transmission
lines to evacuate our power from Karuma and Isimba dams. We completed
and commissioned nine transmission lines totaling 1,038.3 km. These are;
Karuma-Kawanda, Karuma-Olwiyo, Karuma-Lira, Namanve-Luzira, Mutundwe-
Entebbe, Opuyo-Moroto, Gulu-Agago, Kole—Gulu—Nebbi—Arua and Mirama-
Kabale. A further 880 MVA transformation capacity was added to the grid after
commissioning nine new substations. This has brought the cumulative total of
transmission lines to 5,140 km up from 2,354 km in 2019/20.

PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
```
We are on track to achieve our target of 80% access to electricity by 2040.
Our current mission is to reduce the cost of electricity for manufacturers to 5
U.S cents per kWh. When we bought out Umeme, the electricity tariff for extra-
large manufacturers reduced to 5.5 from 8.8 U.S cents per kWh in 2023.
```
The 622 large and 52 extra-large factories we have in the country consume
half of the electricity, while all the 2.4 million domestic consumers use only
23%. As we can all see, when we invest in more factories and fully utilise the
capacity of the existing ones, the current electricity we generate will not be
enough. In addition, as we enter into the knowledge economy, the demand for
electricity will increase exponentially to power e-mobility, the SGR, monorails,
etc. Therefore, we need to generate more electricity for our tenfold growth and
socio-economic transformation.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Construct more electricity generation plants including; Buyende Nuclear
Power Plant (8,600 MW), Kiba Hydropower Plant (400 MW), Solar Power
Plant (500 MW), Wind energy systems (70 MW);
ii) Invest in renewable sources of energy particularly in areas where it is very
expensive to extend the national grid;
iii) Complete electrification of industrial parks, free trade zones, mining sites,
tourism sites;
```
```
iv) Invest in more energy transmission infrastructure;
```
v) Continue to capitalize UEDCL to further reduce the tariff cost; and

vi) Rehabilitate and refurbish our existing energy transmission and distribution
infrastructure to improve grid reliability.

**3.3 Affordable Housing**

The socio-economic transformation principle of NRM has led to rapid
urbanisation. As we educated the _Bazzukulu_ (young people), they emigrated
to towns and cities _en_ masse, looking for jobs and business opportunities. The
latest National Population and Housing Census revealed that Ugandans living in
urban areas have increased to 17.5 million in 2024 from 7.4 million in 2014. As
we can see, in 10 years the urban population has increased by 10 million. These
need affordable and livable housing.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Purchase land, develop it with the requisite infrastructure (roads,
electricity, water, internet etc.) and allocate it to private developers to
construct affordable houses;
ii) Capitalise Housing Finance Bank to reduce the cost of mortgages; and
iii) Capitalise National Housing and Construction Corporation to build
affordable houses.

**1 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT**

The NRM government has continued to prioritize investment in education,
healthcare, water, sanitation and environment. A country cannot
transform without the state investing in its people. Below, we give
accountability of what we have done and what we commit to do in the coming
term, to further improve the lives of Ugandans, by providing them with quality
education, improved healthcare and clean and safe water.

**4.1 Education**

The NRM recognises education as a fundamental human right and a great
social equaliser. Apart from equipping Ugandans with skills required to secure
employment, education enables our people to live longer, happier and affluent
lives.

**4.1.1 Primary Education**

When NRM came to power in 1986, education was only for those who could
afford to pay school fees. The children of the poor were left out of the education
system. In 1997, we abolished the charging of school fees in government-
aided primary schools; and introduced Universal Primary Education (UPE). As
a result, the number of children, enrolled in primary schools, has increased to
9.52 million learners, from 2.5 million in 1997.

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 121
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
The government has built and grant-aided more schools, raising the number
of government-aided primary schools to 12,549 as at June, 2025, from 6,880 in

1997. Today, 6,429 parishes out of 10,584 parishes, have at least one government-
aided primary school. In the last 5 years, we have also constructed 2,228 new
classrooms, renovated 794 classrooms, provided 21,004 desks (3-seater); and
    built 239 primary teachers' houses.

We have recruited more teachers, raising the number to 147,176 in 2025, from
84,825 in 1997 where we started UPE. Subsequently, the pupil-teacher ratio at
primary level has improved to 64:1 in 2025. Our target is to reduce it further
to 53:1. We have bought more textbooks and other instructionAL materials
for primary school learners. In the past five years alone, a total of 2.45 million
copies of science and social studies textbooks, along with 39,000 corresponding
teachers' guides, were distributed to government-aided primary schools.

These efforts account for the rise of the national literacy rate to 74% in 2024,
from 43% in 1986.

**4.1.2 Secondary Education**

In 2007, the NRM introduced free Universal Secondary Education (USE), to
enable children whose parents were unable to pay fees after UPE to continue
with their education. This is in line with our commitment to ensuring equitable
access to quality secondary education for all Ugandans. In 2012, we introduced
the Universal Post 0' Level Education and Training (UPOLET). The total number
of learners in government-aided secondary schools has increased to 1.14 million,
up from 412,367 in 2006. This is on account of our policy of free secondary
school education.

We have since built more secondary schools, recruited teachers and provided
learners and teachers with essential learning and instructional materials
aligned to the new lower secondary curriculum. The number of teachers has
also increased to 37,486, from 29,713 in 2007 when USE started.

```
122 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
In the last five years, we constructed 189 new seed secondary schools and
grant-aided 46 community secondary schools. The number of government-
aided secondary schools, in the country, has thus increased to 1,594 in 2025,
from 1,359 in 2020. Another 258 seed secondary schools are at various levels of
construction. The NRM has been able to increase the number of sub-counties/
town councils with at least one government aided secondary school to 1,147
out of 2,191 sub-counties/town-councils in Uganda.

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
The NRM has provided free learning and instructional materials for government-
aided secondary schools to support implementation of the new lower secondary
curriculum. In order to promote science education, the NRM enhanced the pay of
science teachers by over 300%. We have also stepped-up investment in STEM
(Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics).

In respect to government UPE and USE schools in urban areas, we allowed them
to charge a small fee to cater for utilities (water and electricity). However, this
has been abused by the headteachers charging exorbitant fees, thus, sending
away the children of the poor from these urban schools. We will, therefore,
stop this practice and set fees commensurate with the cost of utilities.

**4.1.3 Higher Education**

When NRM came to power, Uganda had only one university, Makerere University.
To d a y, the country has 78 universities, of which 10 are public. We are in the
process of setting up two more public universities in Busoga and Bunyoro sub-
regions. Before the NRM came to power, only 4,000 students were enrolled
in university. Currently, enrolment in all universities is 220,800. In order to
give opportunity to students from poor families, that fail to get government
sponsorship, the NRM started a student's loan scheme in 2014. A total of 16,436
students have since been supported through this programme. In addition, the
NRM is continuing with its policy of sponsoring 4,000 students per year in
public universities. During the out-going _kisanja,_ we upgraded infrastructure in
various public universities. For example, we reconstructed the Ivory Tower and
some halls of residence at Makerere University.

To improve the qualifications and skills of primary school teachers to meet the
new minimum education requirement of degree level, we have established a
National Institute for Teacher Education (UNITE). The total enrolment in the
institute has reached 1,000 student teachers.

**4.1.4 Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET)**

Our policy on technical education is to have a technical institute in every
constituency. In the last five years, the NRM has made significant investments
in skills development and created a robust skills development eco-system. To
promote TVET, we have constructed 21 TVET institutes in the past five years
bringing the total to 189 in the country. Currently, 130 out of 353 constituencies
have a TVET school and total enrolment is 22,763.

Six (6) of the TVET institutes have been upgraded to centers of excellence
offering internationally recognised certificates. These are: Uganda Technical
College (UTC) Kichwamba, Uganda Petroleum Institute Kigumba (UPIK),
Uganda Technical College Elgon, Bukalasa Agricultural College, Uganda
Te c h n i c a l College Bushenyi, Uganda Technical College Lira. In order to
streamline TVET, we have established a TVET Council to ensure a hands-on,
minds-on and hearts-on practical vocational and technical education.

**a) Presidential Zonal Industrial Hubs**

In order to address the challenge of unemployment among the youth, we
started a skilling programme for youth outside the formal education system.
The programme trains them in various skills such as carpentry, welding, motor
vehicle mechanics, hair dressing and baking free of charge. Formal education
qualifications are not a requirement. The trainees, upon completion of the 6
months period of training are subjected to a Uganda Vocational and Technical
Assessment Board (UVTAB) examination, after which they acquire a level-one
certificate equivalent to an 0' Level (UCE) certificate. So far, 82,790 youth have
been trained, of which 66,631are from Kampala. The total number of presidential
skilling hubs has grown to 28, across the country.

**b) Formalising Artisans**

To formally recognise, promote tradability of skills and encourage fair
compensation of our artisans in garages, saloons, carpentry workshops, etc., we
have started awarding certificates through Uganda Vocational and Technical
Assessment Board. So far, 338,559 artisans have been assessed and awarded
such certificates.

**4.1.5 Special Needs Education**

The NRM believes in equity, fairness, affirmative action and leaving no one
behind. We have provided support to persons with disabilities and special needs.
We have invested in schools to serve children with special needs in different
parts of the country. These are equipped with facilities to train our children with
special needs in carpentry, mechanics, welding and other vocational skills.

```
Digitising Education
```
In order to enhance quality and efficiency in education and fight corruption in
the sector, the NRM has adopted digitisation. The national school register and
school's inspection, are being digitised. All newly constructed seed schools
are now equipped with functional ICT laboratories to support e-learning and
promote digital literacy.

Using a digital system: Teacher Effectiveness and Learner Achievement (TELA),
we are in the process of solving the long-standing challenge of teacher
absenteeism. To implement the system, 14,000 smartphones were distributed to
government-aided schools to "catch" teachers and students who dodge classes.
As a result of utilising this system, the average teacher class attendance has
improved from 27% to 80%. We have also rolled out a system: e-inspection, to
improve school inspection in all the districts, cities and municipalities, across
the country. The system has helped to improve inspection coverage to 86%.

**4.2 Health**

Over the years, the NRM has deepened its commitment to ensure that every
Ugandan enjoys their fundamental and constitutional right to health. Our
strategy on health is two-fold: preventive (health promotion) and curative
(rehabilitative and palliative care).

The NRM inherited a dilapidated health system in 1986. For example,
immunization coverage was 30%; and this was limited to only six (6) killer
diseases of Polio, Diptheria, whooping cough, Tuberculosis, Measles and
Te t a n u s. We have since added eight other immunizable diseases namely:
Hepatitis B (cancer of the Liver), Human Pappiloma Virus (HPV) (cancer of the
cervix), Rota Virus Vaccine (diarrhea), Yellow fever, Measles Rubella vaccine,
Pneumococcal Vaccine (Pneumonia), Haemophilus Influenza Vaccine (Influenza
type B) and Malaria. Our immunization coverage is over 95% and the 5% is on
account of the parents that have not brought their children for immunization.

We have also invested in health infrastructure. Uganda now boasts of 78
hospitals, of which 54 are general hospitals (GH), 16 regional referral hospitals
(RRH), 5 national referral hospitals and 3 specialised hospitals. We have 217
HCIVs at constituency level and 1,553 sub-counties have a health unit of HC III
and above. This is contrasted against only 49 hospitals and 597 dispensaries
that Uganda had in 1986.

```
In the last kisanja, we continued to improve healthcare infrastructure and

capacity oxygen plants across key national, regional referral, and general.
hospitals; continued infrastructure development and equipping of the two
specialised centres for cancer and cardiovascular care; infrastructure
development of Lubowa Specialised Hospital, which is now at advanced stages
of completion. We constructed new maternity wards and staff houses in HCIIIs;
distributed 20 digital X-ray machines to General Hospitals; and installed CT
scans in 14 out of 16 Regional Referral Hospitals. We procured one (1) MRI scan
for Mbarara RRH, and ICU equipment for 14 RRHs. A 250 -bed capacity state-
of-the-art cardiac (heart) hospital is under construction. We also constructed
445 HCIIIs, upgraded 34 HCIIIs to HCIVs, and upgraded 7 HCIVs to District

Hospitals, namely Kotido, Koboko, Luweero, Kyegegwa, Amuria, Rukunyu, and

```
The salaries of medical workers were also enhanced. The budget for medicines
and supplies to enable delivery of quality health care at the various health units
in the country was also increased.

In order to improve monitoring of clinician outputs, patient management and
prevent theft of medicine, the NRM government is rolling out an in-facility
electronic medical record system which is a digital tool for management of
health facility processes. The system has functions for management of medical
supplies, consultations, treatments, procedures, investigations, admissions and
generation of reports. The system is already deployed in 77 health facilities (4
NRH, 15 RRH, 54 GH and 4 HCIV). It has improved documentation and management
of clinician outputs as it is able to show services rendered by each clinician.
Where it has been deployed, we have registered marked reduction in stockouts
of medicines and other medical supplies.

As a result of the above interventions, the health indicators have greatly im-
proved as follows: Mothers delivering at health facilities have now increased to
over 80% from 37% in 2001. The overall maternal mortality ratio has reduced
to 189 per 100,000 live births from 336 per 100,000 live births in the past 10

**4.3 Water for Human Use**

The NRM continues to invest in the provision of clean water, sanitation and hy-
giene (WASH) as well as protection of our environment. Our target is for every
Ugandan has access to water, sanitation and hygiene. Currently, seven (7) in
every ten (10) households have access to clean water and within a walkable dis-
tance of not more than 500 meters. When we came to power, it was only three
(3) in every ten (10) households which had access to clean water; and they had
to walk at least a kilometer to find it.

In the Last _kisanja,_ we added 297 piped water supply and sanitation systems in
various towns across the country, each serving a population of 3,000 to 5,000
people. We have also constructed several gravity flow schemes and drilled
boreholes across the country. As a result, the number of villages with a clean
water source has increased to 57,313 from 38,809 villages, in 2021. Eight (8)
in ten (10) villages now have a clean water source. In water stressed areas
of Moyo, Kyankwanzi, Nakasongola, Rakai, Buyende and Kasese, solar powered
water systems were constructed.

**Our Promise**

**A. Rural Water and Sanitation**

The NRM Strategy is to provide a clean and safe water source in every village.

**4.4 Environment and Natural Resource Management**

Uganda's prosperity and the well-being of its people are closely linked to
the sustainable management of our abundant natural resources. As a nation
blessed with forests, wetlands, vast water bodies, and diverse ecosystems, our
development trajectory depends on our stewardship of this invaluable heritage.
The NRM has consistently championed the protection and sustainable utilisation
of these resources, recognising their critical role in agriculture, energy, tourism,
social wellbeing and overall national development.

Over the last five years, significant strides have been made in managing our
natural resources. We have increased the country's forest cover to 13% from
9.5% in 2015. A crackdown on illegal encroachment and unsustainable practices
has led to the restoration of crucial buffer zones around major water bodies.
We have implemented policies that promote a holistic approach to natural
resource management. We have also empowered local communities to become
stewards of their water resources, with support for initiatives like sustainable
fishing practices and tree planting along riverbanks to prevent soil erosion.

We have also protected our wetlands. Uganda has a wetland cover of 10-13%
of the land area, and these perform functions that are difficult and costly to
replace if lost. The total length of wetlands in Uganda is 144,319.06 km. In the
last five years, we:
i) Demarcated 3,217.43 km with pillars and live markers;
ii) Restored 1,284.90 km' of wetlands;
iii) Gazetted and published 8,614 wetlands;

```
iv) Cancelled 330 certificates of land titles issued in wetlands, and preparations
for cancelling another 300 are in final stages;
```
v) Increased the area under wetland management from 6,507.34 km' to

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 145
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
```
6,669.16 km2 in 2023 and 2024.
```
vi) Sensitised rice farmers in wetlands to voluntarily stop and instead, lawfully
and sustainably re-purpose them for higher incomes as is being done at
Limoto in Kibuku.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Strengthen regulation and enforcement against degradation of our
environment, including protection of our water bodies;
ii) Invest in urban forestry/greening of cities and other urban areas;
iii) Support value addition for sustainable commercial forestry;
iv) Continue promoting the use of alternative sources of energy for cooking,
away from charcoal and firewood, including supporting livestock farmers
to invest in bio-digestors for biogas production;
```
v) Promote private investment in forestry and forestry products;

vi) Establish a wood processing hub at Nyabyeya Forestry College to provide
students with practical training and equipping graduates to meet industry
demands;

vii) Promote sustainable, water-based economic activities, such as regulated
fishing, and eco-tourism to create jobs and foster prosperity while
maintaining the ecological health of our lakes and rivers;

viii) Promote and support wetland alternative livelihood options such as fish
farming against rice growing;

```
ix) Continue to demarcate and restore degraded wetlands including those
along river banks and lake shores; and

5.1 Democracy
```
Democracy is one of the four core principles of the NRM, the others being
Patriotism, Pan-Africanism and Socio-Economic transformation. Our governance
approach is people-centered, based on grassroot systems that are founded on
justice, regular free and fair elections; and protection of individual human rights
and civil liberties. These hard-won constitutional freedoms are the bedrock of
our democracy.

```
The NRM Government inherited a broken democracy, but through concerted
efforts, we restored the vote to the disenfranchised people of Uganda. We
empowered various marginalized groups like women, youth, people with
disabilities and the elderly to become part of decision-making processes right
from Village Councils to the Districts, Cabinet, and Parliament. These special
interest groups have their respective elective councils from village to the
national level. The workers are also represented in Parliament as a special
interest group.
```
```
In the past (post-independence), political parties were inclined towards tribes
and religions. We have fostered governance that promotes unity of all peoples
in Uganda irrespective of tribe, religion and other forms of sectarianism. That is
why NRM has, and will continue to win elections across the country.
```
```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 149
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
Ugandans should recall that the Uganda Peoples' Congress (UPC) Government
had abolished Cultural leaders following the 1966 debacle. We therefore,
deliberately restored Traditional/Cultural leaders in the areas where they are
cherished and these have been supported to perform their roles.

As a way to ensure that human rights are upheld, we set up the Uganda Human
Rights Commission to protect and promote human rights and freedoms in
Uganda. This Commission has powers of the High Court in adjudicating cases
regarding abuse of human rights. We also passed a law against torture which
provides for sanctions on individuals within the security forces who engage in
any form of torture.

We further introduced electoral reforms to restore democracy, such as;

```
i) Ensuring that candidates are given enough time for their nomination at all
levels;
ii) Names of all candidates appearing on the same ballot paper with their
symbols (including photos);
iii) Ballots being cast in the same box on the election day;
iv) Candidates having agents at polling stations and tally centers;
```
v) Voting secretly but in the open. The votes are counted at the polling station
and results declared in the presence of voters;

vi) Entering results of all candidates for a particular post in the declaration of
results forms;

vii) Signing of declaration forms by the candidates' polling agents. Incase
an agent does not agree with the results, they are allowed to state their
concern on the declaration form;

viii) Independent tallying by candidates using the results in the declaration
forms given to the agents at the polling stations or tally centres. In case of

```
150 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
```
any variation with the results announced by the Electoral Commission, the
candidates can challenge the results in courts of law;
ix) Using biometric voter verification technology to identify the voters
through their biometrics, to stop ballot staffing, multiple voting and voting
in another person's name.
```
These reforms have enabled the NRM to create a firm foundation for a solid
democracy and rule of law in Uganda.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Continue to conduct regular free and fair elections;
ii) Continue to support women, youths, People with Disabilities (PWDs),
workers and the elderly to participate in policy and decision making at all
levels. Affirmative Action shall be promoted in all organs of Government;
iii) Promote use of digital technologies in elections, and ensuring careful
monitoring and oversight to prevent manipulation;
iv) Strengthen the National Electoral Commission's capacity to; undertake
mass civic education and to conduct free and fair elections;
```
v) Support the timely handling and resolution of all electoral disputes; and

vi) Continue to support the Inter Party Organization for Dialogue (IPOD) to
promote inter-party dialogue.

**5.2 Decentralisation**

When we took over power in 1986, we introduced the people's councils to
democratize state power, empower citizens, improve public service delivery, and
promote accountability and responsiveness. Our belief is that when the people
manage themselves through their elected leaders, they are served better.

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 151
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
Through decentralisation, we introduced Local Government councils at District/
City/Municipality and sub-county/town council levels, led by directly elected
chairpersons. The district councilors represent sub-counties in the district and
a third of them are women. At the Sub-County Council, the councilors represent
parishes. In all the District and Sub-County Councils the special interest groups
(youth, persons with disabilities, elderly and workers) are represented.

We also decentralised power to these Local Governments to enable them
oversee implementation of Government programmes in their jurisdictions. The
districts have District Service Commissions which are appointed by the District
Chairperson upon approval by the District Council. These District Service
Commissions have power to appoint and discipline (including dismissal) civil
servants in the district, save for the CAO and RDC who are appointed by Central
Government.

The political leaders at the sub-county and district level have a duty to supervise
the services delivered within their area of jurisdiction as a way of checking the
performance of the civil servants. However, there are tendencies of failure by
the political leaders to duly exercise their powers over the civil servants hence,
leading to poor service delivery and overt corruption.

If these Local Governments exercised their powers in the interest of the people,
some of the challenges of corruption and poor service delivery would be unheard
of or would be minimized. For instance, if the councilors and chairpersons at both
sub-counties and districts were active, theft of medicine and staff absenteeism
would be minimised. Also, some of the land disputes would not arise if the Sub-
County Land Committees and District Land Boards were effectively doing their
work.

Where the services are not being delivered to the required standards, the
District Council should be able to bring to order the concerned civil servants.
Furthermore, where the concerned civil servants need to be reprimanded, the

```
152 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
District Service Commissions (DSC) should be able to discipline them, including
dismissal from service in accordance with the law. However, gaps exist in the
performance of these DSCs, and we have been getting reports that some of
them are involved in selling jobs, denying our young people opportunity to
serve. This is going to be dealt with.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Continue to induct new elected leaders on their roles of monitoring and
supervising the delivery of public services within local governments;
ii) Encourage the people who are asked by members of District service
Commission to pay bribes to report to the anti-corruption agencies;
iii) Work towards filling the critical vacancies at all levels in Local
Governments; and
iv) Continue to hold accountability for a (barazas) between the Citizens,
Elected leaders and the Local Government technical team at all levels.
```
**5.3 Fighting Corruption**

Corruption remains one of the major challenges to our democracy and overall
service delivery. While we have made progress in fighting corruption, it remains
a significant challenge that we are determined to defeat.

The NRM has been supporting the fight against corruption through; the
Inspectorate of Government (IGG) to oversee public officer accountability; Office
of the Auditor General (OAG) to independently audit government accounts;
and Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to investigate and prosecute
corruption cases, the CID, Parliament Accountability Committees and other anti-
corruption agencies.

```
We have digitalized a number of government services such as; the online
```
```

```
application for passports, driving permits, Electronic Fiscal Receipting and
Invoicing Solution (EFRIS) for revenue collection, Online Business Registration
System (OBRS) by the URSB, Electronic Government Procurement (e-GP) and
the Electronic Court Cases Management Information Systems (ECCMIS) for
filing and disposal of cases in the judicial system. These have helped to reduce
corruption in service delivery.

We have validated civil servants by taking their biometrics and this process
exposed a number of ghost workers who were on the civil service pay roll. These
were subsequently removed and people responsible are being prosecuted.

**Our Promise.**

```
NRM will:
i) Strengthen the corruption investigative institutions; Inspectorate of
Government (IGG), Office of the Auditor General (OAG); Directorate of
Public Prosecutions (DPP), CID, Parliament Accountability Committees and
other anti-corruption agencies in execution of their mandates;
ii) Sensitize the masses to report corruption cases in accordance with the
Whistle Blowers Act (2011);
iii) Hold Chief Administrative Officers (CAOs), RDCs and DISOs accountable for
their inaction in the fight against corruption;
iv) Sensitize elected local leaders (including NRM party leaders) on their
mandate in monitoring service delivery and where they find faults, they
take action;
```
v) Continue to digitalize the various government service delivery systems
to eliminate corruption. For instance, we will introduce body cameras for
the police. We will ensure that all applications for Government services
(building permits, investment permits, mining permits, etc.) are made online
and responses provided to the applicants in a defined period;

vi) Continue to build the capacity of the Anti-Corruption division of the High
court to efficiently adjudicate corruption cases; and

vii) Progressively enhance salaries for teachers, medical officers, and other
public servants to eliminate corruption of need which is fueled by the
struggle to meet basic needs.

**5.4 Security of Life and Property**

```
One of NRM's core strengths is securing the lives and property of Ugandans.
Before capturing power in 1986, insecurity was widespread throughout Uganda.
Ugandans lived in constant fear; extra-judicial killings and looting were so rife;
people were often hiding whenever they encountered soldiers or policemen.
NRM reversed this reality by creating a professional army, demystifying the
gun, democratizing the country, and fostering positive interactions between
security forces and citizens.
```
We have maintained an unwavering focus on strengthening Uganda's national
security foundations. Through capacity building of the security organs, we have
reinforced state guarantees of security for persons and property. This correlates
with increased respect for human rights and freedoms, and the emergence of a
vibrant civil society.

The capacity of security forces in terms of numbers, quality, and equipment has
improved. For the case of the Uganda Police Force (UPF), the police numbers
have grown from 3,000 in 1986 to 46,000 officers in 2025. Quality has also
improved through emphasis on recruiting better-educated personnel including
university graduates.

Security threats keep on changing as the society grows and the focus now is
to address recent rural and urban criminality as well as Cyber Crime. The NRM
Government has installed CCTV cameras throughout cities and along highways
which have proven effective in apprehending criminals.

```

```
Moving forward, NRM will continue creating pro-people security forces, well
equipped and trained in civilian interaction. We will continue equipping the Police
Force in forensic investigation capabilities to enhance their effectiveness in
fighting crime. Improving the welfare of the UPDF, Police and Prisons personnel
remains a priority.

**5.4.1 Uganda Peoples Defense Forces (UPDF)**

NRM government promised and assured Ugandans that we would continue
building and strengthening the UPDF. This has been done. The national borders
are secure. The UPDF continues to maintain a proactive posture, with zonal and
operational deployments to deal with emerging threats.

Our security forces have undertaken various counter terrorism operations which
have yielded positive results. Within the previous term, UPDF built sufficient
Counter-terrorism capability in terms of personnel and equipment.

In regard to disarmament and anti-stock theft operations in Karamoja, the UPDF
launched operation "Usalama Kwa Wote" in July 2021.This was augmented
with operation "DHUMISHA AMANI" in April 2023 which helped to reduce
Karamojong incursions in Acholi, Teso and tango Sub-regions. The operations
also recovered 49,025 animals which were handed over to the rightful owners.
We also neutralized the ADF who operated from Eastern DRC.

Government has significantly eliminated various criminal gangs such as _Kifeesi,_
B-10 and _Bukolwacrew_ within Kampala Capital City. This has curtailed subversive
activities, creating a conducive environment to support of the government's
socio-economic transformation agenda.

Cyber insecurity has been an emerging threat due to advancement in technology.
The army established a cyber-security unit to detect, prevent and curtail acts
of cyber-crime and built capacity to handle cyber threats. In April 2023, the
Ugandan Government established the National Forensic science university in

```

```
Jinja which offers courses in cyber security Studies, Forensic investigations, and
information science.

In addition, the UPDF Fisheries Protection Unit continues to combat illegal
fishing and smuggling of fish in the country. Over 90,900 tons of immature
fish and assorted illegal fishing gear worth billions had been impounded and

territories (under Operation Shujaa). The UPDF also maintains deployments
under the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS). Subsequently,
democratic processes have been undertaken to rebuild Somalia and piracy
on the Indian Ocean was controlled. Further, in the Pan-African spirit, Uganda
provides military training support to Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Guinea Bissau
through bilateral arrangements.

The NRM Government continued the professionalization and modernization
of the defense and security forces through recruitment, training, acquisition
of equipment and enhancement of personnel welfare. We acquired, equipped,
maintained and refurbished military equipment to facilitate quick response to
the prevailing and emerging security threats.

In 2022, the NRM Government established the National Defense College-Uganda
(NDC-U) dedicated to providing advanced military education and strategic
training to high-ranking military and civilian officials in Uganda. Furthermore,
salary enhancement for UPDF, UPF and Prison Services personnel has been
implemented through a phased approach.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will;
i) Continue to professionalize the UPDF by continuing to train its personnel
and equip it with modern weapons, equipment and technology;
ii) Enhance protection of vital assets and security installations which are
crucial to national development;
iii) Safeguard Uganda's Digital Sovereignty;
iv) Strengthen efforts to counteract radicalism and ensure stability of the
country;
```
**v) Strengthen capacity of UPDF to participate in production and value

vi) Continue to enhance the welfare of the UPDF personnel;

vii) Establish and operationalise a National Service program to build patriotism;
and

viii) Enhance coordination of national security and intelligence infrastructure
to maintain peace and stability across the country.

**5.4.2 The Uganda Police Force (UPF)**

Given Uganda's population of 45.9 million people and the recommended UN
policing ratio of 1:500, UPF should have a force with a strength of 91,306
personnel. The current personnel strength is 50,826 leaving a gap of 40,480.
Uganda Police continues to recruit and train personnel to fill this gap.

In an effort to professionalize the security forces, 12,325 Police Officers and
2,649 prisons officers have respectively undergone Command and Leadership,
Specialised courses, refresher and initial training courses.

We are progressively creating a pro- people force that is well trained to handle
civilians, UPF kick-started operationalization of the sub county policing model
with Greater Masaka Police Region. So far, 98 sub county police stations are
implementing the policing model in this Region.

Government has equipped the police in forensic investigations to improve
fighting against crime, the capacity of the police has been enhanced to enable it
effectively perform its mandate. The canine department for example has been
expanded to increase capacity for suspects apprehension.

Government through the Directorate of Government Analytical Laboratories
(DGAL) is undertaking construction of the DNA databank. This will support
Intelligence and Crime Investigations which ultimately strengthen the National
Security and criminal identification. Additionally, will also eliminate massive
arrests of suspects before evidence is obtained.

The Flying Squad has been rebuilt and reorganized. The 999 Field units have been
deployed in all the 18 divisions of KMP with the attendant re-activation of the
999/112 Emergency Dispatch System. This "999"/ERU Police Patrol system has
also been decentralised to 07 policing regions- Mbale, Gulu, Masaka, Mbarara,
Arua, Hoima, Jinja, Lira and Soroti. The Central National Emergency call center
handles KMP and the regions not yet decentralised. In addition, communication
is being improved by acquisition of more radios and re- activation of the Police
signals department.

Counter phones were deployed at every Police Station to allow for quick
communication between the station and the public especially during response
to distress or emergencies.

To enhance Police protection, 17 new Police Stations were established in other
areas like Kwania, Kapelebyong, Rukungiri, Bululu, Busia, Nakasongola, Katwe-
Kabatooro, West Nile Regional Headquarters, Kiira Regional Headquarters,
Savannah Regional Headquarters in Luweero the others are in the Karamoja
region (Namalu, Alakas, Nakiloro, Apeitolim, Lokori, Nakaperimoru and Morulem).
The regulatory framework for Private Security Organizations (PSOs) is
undergoing comprehensive review to improve oversight and control, this
includes training standardization, recruitment of personnel and acquisition
of security equipment. In order to strengthen supervision and compliance of
PSOs, management has suspended operations of 26 PSOs who were in default
of expected standards (statutory obligation).

Government enhanced the capability of the Uganda Police Force through
acquisition of assorted security equipment to facilitate effective response to
emergencies and management of crime. These include light armoured personnel
carriers for public order management, pickup vehicles and troop and logistics
carriers.

Government constructed and commissioned 528 Police staff houses across
the country and also installed 5,410 double occupancy uniports to temporarily
mitigate accommodation challenges thus the number of entitled police
officers housed has increased to 26%. With the completion of the 364 ongoing
construction works in FY2023/24 at Jinja, Entebbe and Naguru, the number of
entitled officers housed is expected to improve.

With the completion of the Criminal Intelligence Headquarters in Kololo, district
police stations in Kwania & Kapelebyong, the number of own office space has
increased from 84 to 87 thus saving on rent. A total of 124 Housing units were
renovated in Soroti, Entebbe and Mbale and asbestos roofs that was declared a
health hazard were replaced with iron sheets.
Government is working on a housing project under the Private, Public Partnership
(PPP) arrangement to construct 69,000 housing units across the country for
Police.

Over 3,746 (586 female) Police officers had benefitted from low priced
construction items from Duty Free Shop.

**Our promise**

The NRM is committed to professionalize and modernize the Police Force to
enable it fight crime and impunity. We will:

```
i) Implement the sub-county policing model to ensure that the optimal
execution of a unified rural policing strategy;
ii) Recruit more personnel to achieve a ratio of 1:500;
iii) Increase efforts to undertake specialised training of the Police Force to
build its capacity in police management and in areas like; crowd control,
human rights, cyber crime, etc;
iv) Provide the Police Force with modern equipment, i.e. body cameras,

viii) Continue with implementation of the Intelligent Transportation Monitoring
System (ITMS) to monitor vehicles and respond to traffic security threats.

**5.5 Promoting Justice and Rule of Law**

In 1986, we inherited a lawless country, devoid of constitutionalism and rule of
law, characterised by extra judicial killings and anarchy. In order to correct this
problem, we set up a constitutional commission which gathered the views of the
population on how they wanted to be governed. Thereafter, we asked Ugandans
to elect their representatives to debate and promulgate the constitution in 1995.
Where we have amended the constitution, we have done it through the people's
representatives in parliament.

As provided for in the constitution, we built an independent Judiciary which
supports stability, justice, rule of law, sustainable development, and prosperity
for all.

In order to improve the terms of service of the judicial officers, we enacted
the Administration of Judiciary Act, 2020 which among others provides for;
the efficient and effective administration of the Judiciary; strengthening the
independence of the Judiciary; and retirement benefits of judicial officers and
related matters.

**Progress**

The NRM has improved access to justice by bringing the courts closer to the

```
**5.6 Labour and Employment**

Since 1986, the NRM has stood firm in protecting the dignity of Ugandan workers
and ensuring that their labour remains critical for national transformation. Our
focus has been to create an environment that enables the private sector to
create jobs. As earlier stated under the economy section, the task has been to
avail affordable patient capital, incentives (provision of free land in industrial
parks) and as a result, we now have 50,000 factories providing employment.
Other areas like agriculture, through the support of OWC have been able to
create jobs. The Parish Development Model is also broadening the spectrum of
jobs.

```
On the political side, we have recognized workers as a special interest group
and these have representation at various levels of decision-making including
```
```
166 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
Parliament. This was deliberately done to ensure that the voices of the workers
are heard. Furthermore, we have expanded access to education, which has
resulted into a more supply of labour especially from the youth. We are now
emphasising on vocational education so as to produce the necessary critical
skills required in the job market.

As the country advances towards high middle-income status, our workers will
continue to play a central role in the development of our country.

NRM strengthened labour governance policies that improved protection
for workers, clarified employer obligations, and promoted decent work. The
establishment of the Industrial Court, Medical Arbitration Board, Labour
Advisory Boards have improved dispute resolution and strengthened social
dialogue among employers, workers, and government. The government has
also ratified key ILO conventions which have helped to align national labour
standards with international best practices. NRM will further work to reduce
unemployment and improve working conditions.

```
Our Promise:
```
```
NRM will;
i) Continue to attract investments which will lead to creation of jobs. The
more investments we attract, the better the terms for workers arising
from the increased demand for jobs;
ii) Continue to support our wealth creation initiatives as drivers of new
employment opportunities;
iii) Continue to train our people in the relevant skills that align with the job
market;
```
```
iv) Strengthen compliance with labour laws, policies, guidelines, standards
and rights to among other things improve Occupational Safety and Health
(OSH) management across the country;
```
```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 167
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
v) Special attention will be given to safeguarding fair wages, timely payment
of salaries, and secure employment contracts to shield workers from
casualization and exploitation;

vi) Ensure that industrial parks have designated areas for development of
convenient workers' housing; and

vii) Develop a National Management Information System (MIS)/Database on
Labour Force and Enterprise to provide reliable data to guide policy-making,
monitor employment trends, assess skills gaps, enforce labour standards,
and support investment and social protection planning.

**5.7 Affirmative Development Initiatives**

The NRM Government has over the years implemented various affirmative
development programmes in areas which were affected by war. Some of these
programmes included;
(i) Northern Uganda Rehabilitation Programme (NURP)
(ii) Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF I, II and III)
(iii) Peace Recovery and development Plan (PRDP I, II, and III)
(iv) Cattle restocking
(v) Cattle compensation

```
(vi) Luwero-Rwenzori Development programme
```
Cumulatively, the NRM Government has spent over Shs. 4 trillion on these
programmes. We will continue to implement the affirmative programmes to
further ameliorate the effect of war and conflict caused in these areas.

```
168 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031

```
**a) Cattle compensation**

In regard to implementation of the livestock compensation exercise of war debt
claimants and/beneficiaries in Acholi, tango and Teso sub-regions. The NRM
Government has so far paid Shs 159.50 bn to 28,281 Claimants and/Beneficiaries
in the Sub-Regions of Acholi, tango and Teso Sub-Region. Specifically; 4,836
claimants from Acholi Sub-Region were paid a total of Shs 43,666,954,842;
in tango Sub-Region 12,389 Claimants/beneficiaries were paid a total of Shs
48,736,020,500 in Teso Sub-Region 11,056 claimants/beneficiaries were paid a
total of Shs 65,912,898,246.

**b) NUSAF**

NUSAF has been one of the largest safety-net programs targeting households
in the poorest and most vulnerable districts in Northern and Eastern Uganda.
Under NUSAF, 67 districts were covered and benefited nearly 600,000
households (approx. 3 million persons). All three phases of NUSAF have focused
on expanding safety nets, promoting sustainable livelihoods and building
institutional capacity at the local level.
Implementation of this programme has made positive impact on the poor and
vulnerable households. However, not-withstanding the achievements of the
various interventions, significant socio-economic challenges still remain in the
area. Hence the need to implement NUSAF IV.
NUSAF IV is designed to continue improving the livelihoods of the communities
and will cover 83 districts, 7 cities in 6,631 parishes of Northern, Eastern
Uganda and Bunyoro. NUSAF will support an estimated total 3,375,000 rural
smallholders in the agricultural value chain by enhancing production, agro
processing and marketing services thereby contributing to increased income
earnings, improved savings and help the extremely poor and vulnerable to get
out of poverty.

```
**5.8 Land Governance**

The size of Uganda is 241,038 sq. km of which 197,100 sq. km is covered by land.
Over the years, Ugandans have enjoyed this resource as a source of livelihood.
Before colonialism, land was available for communal use: held for grazing
purposes and small-scale subsistence agriculture. Land tenure and management
was perpetually customary where clan leaders held land in trust on behalf of
the clan members, a practice that has remained upheld to present day in some
parts of Uganda. These inherent traditions of land ownership and use could
only be distorted by a force foreign to them through colonialism leading to a
number of historical errors.

The 1900 Buganda Agreement introduced a number of changes in land
ownership. Land ownership became more individualized. For instance, before
this agreement, the Kabaka of Buganda owned land as a trustee of the dwellers
of the land. However, the Agreement divided land ownership in Buganda into
crown land (under the control of the colonial government) and mailo land
(owned by the Kabaka, the chiefs and other prominent leaders at the time).
In the rest of present-day Uganda, the situation was not different. In Acholi,

```
170 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
Lango, Karamoja, and some parts of Bukedi up to now, land is owned by the clans
on behalf of its members. In short, the colonial period changed the traditional
communal use of land and exposed it to market forces of supply and demand.
The distribution of interests in land to some individuals at the expense of others
led to a number of social inequalities. For example, in the case of Buganda, mailo
titles were issued on land which was already occupied hence, the occupants
became tenants of the landlord and were required by law to pay a tax (obusuulu
and _envujjo)_ to the new mailo land owner.

This created two classes of people on the land; the mailo owner and the _kibanja_
holder (tenant). The tenancy rights of _bibanja_ owners were formalised in 1928,
when the colonial Government sensing that the continued increase of the
land tax by the landlord was causing unrest, passed the Busuulu and Envujjo
Law (1928). The law created new relations between landlords and tenants by
reducing the arbitrariness in tax levy (busuulu) and insecurity in those relations.
It denied the landlords the power to charge an economic rent and kept it nominal
to safeguard tenants from exploitation and eviction.

This dual ownership of land in Buganda, with a controlled busuulu, stayed on
until 1975 when The Land Reform Decree of 1975, enacted by Idi Amin's regime
significantly altered land ownership in Uganda by nationalising all land and
converting freehold titles to leases. The Land Decree declared all land in Uganda
public land and title to it was vested in the Uganda Land Commission (ULC).

As a consequence of this change, mailo landowners lost their land without
compensation. All land, including mailo, was converted into leaseholds. This in
effect deprived the people of their right to full ownership of land.

The NRM, through its principles of democracy and socio-economic
transformation, championed good land governance by introducing reforms
in land tenure and management systems. These included the enactment
of the 1995 Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, and the 1998 Land Act
as amended. In the 1995 Constitution, ownership of land was returned to

```
MANIFESTO 2026-2031 • 171
```

```
NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
```
the citizens of Uganda thus restoring mailo land alongside the other tenure
systems: Customary, Freehold, and Leasehold. In effect, NRM balanced the
interests of the landlords and the tenants by returning land to the landlords
but also recognized the legal interests of the _bibanja_ owners. We recognized
six categories of _bibanja_ owners:

a. The one that was given _kibanja_ by the landlord or his agent;

```
b. The one who was on that kibanja in 1983 or before — whom we termed the
bonafide occupant;
```
c. The one that was first to settle on former public land, subject to a 12 -year
occupation rule (having been on that land before October 1983);

d. The one who bought from one of (`a'2I3' and 'c') above;

e. The one who inherited from one of (b) and (c) above;

f. Those that were settled by the Government like the ones settled in Kisiita
(Kakumiro district) and Kanyaryeru (Kiruhura district).

All these six categories are lawful tenants by occupancy and are entitled to be
issued with certificates of occupancy and it is reflected on the Mailo owner's
title as an encumbrance. Therefore, nobody should evict them. We also agreed
that the _bibanja_ owners pay a nominal/reasonable rent, not the market rate.
We further agreed to capitalize the Land Fund annually to compensate the
landlords on a "willing buyer/willing seller" basis, and give the land back to
the sitting tenants upon verification. Through this fund, we have compensated
several absentee landlords in Bunyoro, Ankole, Tooro and Buganda. The above
legal position notwithstanding, the common land problems that have persisted
include:

a. Eviction of lawful tenants on mailo land in disregard of the Constitution
and the 1998 Land Act as amended;
b. In settling with tenants, some landlords issue titles for less acreage
to tenants. For instance, if a _kibanja_ owner has settled on 10 acres, the

```
172 • MANIFESTO 2026-2031
```

```
PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
```
landlord takes six acres and gives a title for only four acres to the kibanja
owner. This is an injustice to the bibanja owners;
c. District Land Boards allocating unregistered customary land that is already
occupied by customary owners who are recognized by the Constitution;
d. Untitled land, creating barriers for the owners to use as collateral in
financial institutions or to lease out to investors;
e. Multiple titling of land by unscrupulous land dealers "bafere" in connivance
with corrupt officers in the land management institutions;
```
f. Lack of notification to the lessee about renewal of the lease upon expiry
and land is allocated to another person.

```
g. Corruption in the court system involving judicial officers entertaining cases
where people on the land are not served notice and they lose the case in
absentia;
h. Traditional cultural practices that deny vulnerable groups like women,
persons with disabilities, children, youth among others from inheriting land;
i. Land fragmentation in respect to rural agricultural land which has affected
the full economic use of land;
```
```
In order to address the land problems above, a number of interventions were
undertaken;
```
**Securing Land Rights**

The Uganda Land Commission acquired 248,790.55 acres from absentee
Landlords for sitting occupants in Bunyoro, Ankole, Buganda, Bugisu and Toro.

(ii) In order to secure the rights of customary land owners, Government has
developed two systems;
a) the Systematic Land Adjudication and Certification (SLAAC) to issue
freehold titles to sitting customary owners under the freehold tenure
system. This involves mobilization, sensitization, surveying and issuance
of land titles to the owners at a subsidised fee of Shs. 85,000 irrespective
of the size of land. This is issued by the Registrar of Titles. Under this
programme, we have processed and issued 24,000 titles to beneficiaries in
Kiruhura, Ibanda, Rwampara, Kaabong and 0yam and the city of Mbarara;

```
For the faith-based institutions, Government pledged to assist them
to register their land upon submission of applications. So far, Church
of Uganda has submitted 3,107 applications from its 39 dioceses for
processing and issuance of freehold land titles;
b) Issuance of Certificates of Customary Ownership (CCOs) under the
customary tenure system. This involves mobilization, sensitization,
surveying and issuance of certificates of ownership at a subsidised
fee of Shs. 10,000 irrespective of the size of land. Under a self-
financing model, a minimal operational fee between Shs. 70,000 to
Shs. 100,000 is set by the District Local Governments to facilitate and
sustain customary land registration. The CCO is issued by a Recorder
at sub-county/ town council and in the case of a city, it is at the division
level. So far 103,000 certificates have been issued in the districts of;
Kasese, Nwoya, Pader, Butaleja, Adjumani, Kisoro, Kabale, Mbale and
Mbale City, Agago, Apac, Maracha, Soroti, Katakwi, Kalaki, Dokolo,
Amolatar, Terego, Gulu, Koboko, Moroto, Amudat, Kaabong, Nabilatuk,
Nakapiripirit, and Namutumba;
The issuance of certificates is aimed at improving the land tenure
security (mitigate risks of land evictions, grabbing, landlessness and
economic well-being);
Government supported the registration and incorporation of 915
clans and communities in the Greater North to become legal entities
called Communal Land Associations (CLAs). For example, 15,000 acres
of communal lands owned by the Omiya Pacwa, Lapono and Paimol
clans were secured and consolidated for leasing to investors under
the Parish to Market (P2M) project in the sub region;
```
(iii) In order to protect the rights of tenants on registered land under the mailo
tenure system, Government introduced the Land Inventory Protocol (LIP)
as social evidence of occupancy and the Certificates of Occupancy (CODs)
as legal evidence of possession. Under these processes, Government
demarcates the _kibanja_ of the tenants and if you have the evidence of
paying busuulu, you get the COO and if not, you get the LIP.

```
The reason most people do not have Certificates of Occupancy (CODs) is
because the current living landlords do not have Letters of Administration
to update the ownership of the mailo land title. The Certificates of
Occupancy (CODs) and Land Inventory Protocols (LIPs) are registered as
encumbrances on the Registered Proprietor's mailo title, hence the kibanja
holder should never be evicted from the land;
So far 104,340 Land Inventory Protocols (LIPs) and 558 Certificates of
Occupancy (CODs) have been processed and issued acrossthe country. These
have returned peace, harmony and productivity to the tenants without any
further threat of eviction. However, in some places like Butambala District,
2,043 parcels of land have been mapped out but politicians de-campaigned
the exercise and as a result, the affected people have not received their
certificates; and
(iv) We have also reduced the average time in processing a land title from 15 to
10 days.
```
**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Continue implementing the mass titling (Systematic Land Adjudication and
Certification and Mobile land Registration) across the country and issue
freehold titles to the siting customary owners;
ii) Continue the land registration of customary owners (individual, family
and communal lands) in accordance with the law and issue them with
Certificates of Customary Ownership (CCOs);
iii) Increase the Land Fund to; complete payment for 71,094.025 acres of land
which have been partially paid for, pay for 57,331.64 acres of land which
has already been valued, and acquire more land from the mailo landlords
and give titles to the sitting bibanja owners upon verification;

where the landlord-tenant relationship exists;
v) Investigate cases of multiple titling, cancel any titles issued in error and
hold accountable those involved;
vi) Firmly deal with the individuals from law enforcement agencies who
participate in illegal land evictions;
vii) Invest in technologies such as blockchain and Artificial Intelligence to
combat fraud and forgeries in the land management;
viii) Reduce the turnaround time in land transactions from 10 to 7 working days;
ix) Rectify old survey data and cancel any title given out on a wetland and
other environmentally fragile areas;
x) Compensate remaining kingdom land and properties; and
xi) Compensate the remaining110 ranchersunder the Government restructured
ranching program.

**6 REGIONAL INTEGRATION AND**

**POLITICAL FEDERATION**

pan-Africanism is one of the core principles of the NRM. This is a key pillar
guiding our cooperation framework with fellow Africans. We recognise the
need for our unity as a basis of rewriting the mistakes that the colonialists
made in dividing us. The political balkanisation of Africa created small states,
many of which have small populations. Uganda, with 46 million people, is one of
the bigger states. The solution to this problem is regional integration.

The whole of Africa has got a very high population of 1.4 billion people, but, this
population is broken up into small units. Small populations mean small markets.
The problem is compounded by low purchasing power because of low incomes.
There are also problems in the regional market, such as lack of roads and lack of
communication to enable us to fully exploit the regional market. That is why, for
instance, Uganda undertook with DRC, to construct the Mpondwe-Beni highway,
to ease connectivity between the two countries. If we mobilise the whole of Africa
to remove all trade barriers, we shall no longer worry about being shut out of
markets in Europe, the USA, etc.

We cannot guarantee our prosperity unless we give our producers of goods
and services a big market through market integration in the whole of Africa.
The NRM, right from the time of our Chairman's student activities in 1963 ,
realised that internal markets of many of the individual countries are never big
enough to enable the prosperity of the citizens of countries. It was that search
for the integration of markets that caused the unifications of Germany in 1871
and Italy in 1860. China and India, each with an internal market of 1.3 billion
people, could not realize rapid growth of their economies until they opened their
economies to enable trade and the inflow of investments from the whole world.

```

PROTECTING THE GAINS
```
That is why we supported the Abuja Treaty of 1991 and the CFTA of 2017. These
were all to create the Free Continental market of Africa, so as to, precisely, solve
the problems Uganda is facing right now — too much sugar, too much maize,
too much bananas, too much cassava, too much milk etc. It is not too much of
anything. It is only too much of disorganisation. With a well-functioning African
free market, this issue will be addressed. However, market integration alone,
even if it is consummated, cannot solve the problem of strategic inferiority in
defense terms against global threats unless we also carry out political integration
(the Federation of East Africa, etc.); the two — economic and political integration
— will help us to preserve our African identity and heritage. More importantly,
East Africa can negotiate more credibly with the other international players —
the USA, China, India, Russia, etc.

Therefore, ideologically speaking, our enemies are the ones who push for
parochialism and sectarianism (tribalism and religious sectarianism) because
they do not understand the value of economic integration for prosperity and
political integration for strategic security against all and every threat.

The NRM, therefore, worked with Kenya and Tanzania to revive the EAC and
expand it to include Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan. We are now exporting
to the region goods and services to the tune of USD 2.84 billion in FY 2024/25,
yet this is just the start. Much more is possible and much more will be achieved.

**Our Promise**

```
NRM will:
i) Support implementation of activities leading to EAC Political Federation
including the promulgation of the EAC Constitution;
ii) Work within the EAC framework to establish a single EAC currency;
iii) Work with other EAC member countries to eliminate all non-tariff barriers
within the EAC;
iv) Promote the use of Kiswahili language across the country; and
```
v) Take advantage of the provisions in AfCFTA agreement to increase trade
with other African countries.

**/ CONCLUSION**

```
n all the pro-people struggles that the NRM has led, we have always been
careful to employ the appropriate strategy and tactics, guided by our four
principles of Patriotism, Pan-Africanism, Socio-Economic Transformation and
Democracy.
```
Five years ago, we promised you five key deliverables: recovering the economy
from COVID 19 and other shocks, and creating jobs and wealth for all Ugandans;
continuing to offer Ugandans free education, healthcare and clean water;
ensuring justice and equity by maintaining law and order; protecting life and
property of all our people; and deepening economic integration to secure
markets for our wealth creators. In total, we made 809 commitments/promises
to Ugandans.

Dear Ugandans, NRM is a reliable and accountable political organisation. Not
even COVID 19, Ebola, international and regional conflicts, inflation in the global
economy (i.e. high commodity prices, for items like soap, fuel, cooking oil, etc.),
and high interest rates that plagued the world during the last _kisanja_ could
stop us from delivering on our promises. We have delivered 698 out of the
809 commitments/promises we made. This translates to 86.3%, and this, by all
standards is a grade for A-Students.

In this manifesto we are committing to protect the gains of the people
of Uganda that the NRM was, right from the beginning, ready to die for.
We are promising to continue growing the economy and creating wealth

```

for all Ugandans. We will continue championing mass line programmes
that ensure the social uplift of all segments of society and not just
a few elites. We also commit to continue investing in free education,
healthcare and water for our people; and securing their lives and property
while guaranteeing their democracy. With these, Uganda will make a
qualitative leap into a high middle-income economy of USD 500 billion.

Therefore, People of Uganda, vote for H.E. Y.K. Museveni for President and
other NRM flag-bearers at all levels.
